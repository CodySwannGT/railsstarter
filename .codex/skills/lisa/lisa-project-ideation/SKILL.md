name: lisa-project-ideation
description: "Generate persona-grounded, verifiable product ideas for the host project, then create PRDs for the selected build-ready ideas via lisa:research. First derives the personas the project actually serves (from its docs, code, data model, and releases — never invented), ideates per persona, and gates each idea on an obtainable data/source path and an empirical verification plan. Creates one PRD by default (top-ranked idea); max_prds widens the batch. prd_ready=true creates them prd-ready for auto-pickup by lisa:intake; default is draft for human review."

## Lisa Command Compatibility

- Original Claude command: `/lisa:project-ideation`
- Codex invocation: `$lisa-project-ideation` or a plain-English request that matches this skill.
- Treat the user's surrounding request as the command arguments.
- Claude argument hint: `[target path | external product] [prd_ready=true|false] [max_prds=<n>|all]`

Use the /lisa:project-ideation skill to derive evidence-grounded personas, ideate per persona, gate the ideas, and create PRDs for the selected build-ready ideas via lisa:research — in draft state by default, or prd-ready when prd_ready=true; one PRD by default, more with max_prds. Use the user's surrounding request as this command's arguments.
