## Lisa Command Compatibility

- Original Claude command: `/lisa:doctor`
- Codex invocation: `$lisa-doctor` or a plain-English request that matches this skill.
- Treat the user's surrounding request as the command arguments.
- Claude argument hint: `[--migration]`

Use the lisa-wiki-doctor skill to run the post-migration/post-setup verification checklist: structure & config, integrity & safety, no-loss/parity, runtime surfaces on both runtimes, functional smoke tests (no extra PR), mode-specific, and git/CI/distribution. Write wiki/state/migration/doctor-report.json and report the verdict + blocking items. Use the user's surrounding request as this command's arguments.
