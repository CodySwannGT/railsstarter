# Set up LLM Wiki automations: $ARGUMENTS

This skill is a **specification, not a script.** It tells the current runtime which recurring wiki
automation to create, on what cadence, and with which command — and the runtime creates it with its
**native** scheduling mechanism. Do **not** hand-template schedule files or write shell to create
them; invoke the runtime's automation tool with the spec below.

It is the wiki counterpart of the base `/lisa:setup-automations`. It is a **separate** skill because
the wiki plugin (`lisa-wiki`) is standalone — it can be installed without the base Lisa plugin, in
which case `/lisa:setup-automations` is not present to schedule ingest. The two skills are
independent and use disjoint name prefixes, so running both is safe.

## Runtime scheduler (branch on the current runtime)

- **Codex** → create a Codex **automation** via the native automations mechanism (prefer the
  `automation_update` tool over hand-writing `~/.codex/automations/<id>/automation.toml`; the TOML is
  only its backing store). Set the execution environment to **local** so it runs on this
  workstation. Scope it to a durable project automation checkout, not a transient task worktree: use
  `${CODEX_HOME:-~/.codex}/worktrees/<project>-automation-main` when available, create or refresh
  that checkout from the project's `origin` remote if needed, and verify `git -C <cwd> rev-parse
  --is-inside-work-tree --is-bare-repository` reports `true` then `false` before saving the
  automation. Do not point recurring automations at hashed scratch worktrees or a checkout whose Git
  metadata is broken.
- **Claude** → use **`/schedule`** to create a local recurring routine.
- **Other runtimes** → use the runtime's native recurring-task mechanism. If the runtime has none,
  state that scheduling is unavailable and stop.

## Parameters

- `cadence` (default **daily**) — how often the full ingest runs. Accepts `daily`, `weekly`, or an
  `every-<n>-hours` form. Map to a Codex `rrule`: daily → `FREQ=DAILY;INTERVAL=1`; weekly →
  `FREQ=WEEKLY;INTERVAL=1`; every N hours → `FREQ=HOURLY;INTERVAL=<n>`. On Claude, pass the
  equivalent `/schedule` cadence. Default is **daily** (`FREQ=DAILY;INTERVAL=1`).

## The automation to create

The automation runs **one cycle** of the full wiki ingest and respects that command's own confirmation
and commit/PR policy (never ask before running; run a full ingest across every enabled
non-external-write source; commit/PR per the ingest skill's bookends; report the cycle summary).
Before running the ingest, the automation must attempt to sync its checkout: fetch the default remote
branch and rebase the current automation branch onto it (for the common GitHub case, `origin/main`).
If the checkout is already on the default branch, fast-forward/rebase it to the remote default. A
dirty working tree is not by itself a blocker: capture `git status --short --branch`, leave
pre-existing changes untouched, and continue when sync and ingest can run without overwriting those
paths. Abort only when Git reports an actual sync conflict or ingest would need to modify an
already-dirty path; in that case leave existing queue/wiki state unchanged and report the exact
conflicting path(s).

| Automation | Command it runs | Cadence |
|---|---|---|
| **wiki-ingest** | `/lisa-wiki:ingest` (no argument → full ingest across all enabled sources) | once a day (or `cadence`) |

**Naming + scope (so teardown is precise).** Name the automation with the stable prefix
`lisa-wiki-auto-<project>-` (i.e. `lisa-wiki-auto-<project>-ingest`), where `<project>` identifies
this repo, and scope each Codex automation to the durable project automation checkout described
above. This prefix is deliberately distinct from the base `lisa-auto-<project>-` set so
`/lisa-wiki:tear-down-automations` removes exactly this automation and never touches the base
automations or any other project's. Use a project identifier stable across runs and distinct from
other repos (qualify it, e.g. with the owner — don't rely on a bare repo basename that could
collide).

**Idempotent.** Re-running this skill updates the existing `lisa-wiki-auto-<project>-ingest`
automation in place (same name) rather than creating a duplicate.

## Conditions / guards

- Create the automation only when this repo actually has an LLM Wiki — i.e. `wiki/` exists with a
  `wiki/lisa-wiki.config.json`. If there is no configured wiki, **stop and report** that the wiki
  must be set up first (run `/lisa-wiki:setup`); do not schedule ingest against a non-existent wiki.
- If the runtime has no native scheduler, stop and report what's missing rather than guessing.
- For Codex, if the durable checkout cannot be created, fetched, or verified as a non-bare Git work
  tree, stop and report the checkout problem instead of creating an automation that will fail later.

## Report

List the automation created or updated (name, the command it runs, the resolved cadence), or report
that it was skipped and why (no configured wiki / no runtime scheduler).
