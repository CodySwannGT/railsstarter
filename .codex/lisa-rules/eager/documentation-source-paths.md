# Documentation Source Paths (load-bearing)

Do not treat `docs/`, `research/`, `transcripts/`, or other source-material directories as disposable duplicates just because a project also has a `wiki/`. They may be ingestion inputs, executable fixtures, runtime inputs, or historical evidence.

Before moving, absorbing, or deleting documentation-like paths:

1. Classify each path: durable wiki content, reader-safe source note, executable test fixture, runtime scratch/input, generated output, or obsolete.
2. Use `rg` to find every code, test, script, config, README, rule, skill, agent, and wiki reference to the path.
3. Preserve executable fixtures and runtime inputs OUTSIDE the wiki — they are project behavior, not documentation.
4. When absorbing into `wiki/`, update source notes, indexes, logs, README links, rule references, and runtime defaults that pointed at the old path.
5. Delete a path only AFTER references are updated and verification proves the project no longer reads it.
