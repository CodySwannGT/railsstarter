# Usage Accounting (load-bearing)

Lisa attaches AI usage and cost telemetry to every artifact it creates/updates. The format is a single canonical managed section.

## Managed section

Every artifact with inline body content gets exactly one section:

```markdown
## Lisa Usage
```

**Canonical. Rewrite in place; never append a second usage section.** If the host can't safely edit body, write the same section in a comment and treat that comment as the managed artifact for future rewrites.

## Required field semantics

Each direct entry records ONE logical Lisa run on ONE artifact. `entry_id` is the stable dedupe key — rewriting the same logical run with the same `entry_id` updates in place; a different run gets a different `entry_id`.

- **`source`**: `observed` (runtime supplied) / `estimated` (derived from trustworthy metadata + pricing contract) / `unavailable`.
- **`pricing_status`**: same trinary plus `missing` (cost not known but should be).
- **Absence ≠ zero.** `null` means unknown; `0` means explicitly zero. Always write the entry — never silently omit.
- Do NOT replace observed counts with estimates.

## Rollup

Container artifacts (Epic, PRD, etc.) roll up usage from their direct children. Roll-up is recursive — a parent's `## Lisa Usage` aggregates its descendants' direct entries. Re-writes are idempotent: re-running an intake or lifecycle skill must not duplicate entries.
