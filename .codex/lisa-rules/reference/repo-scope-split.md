# Repo Scope & Work-Time Splitting

Leaf work units are single-repo. A **leaf work unit** is an individually implementable ticket with no open child tickets — the by-design leaf types **Bug, Task, Sub-task, Improvement**, plus a childless **Story** or **Spike** (a childless Story/Spike is structurally a leaf — see `leaf-only-lifecycle`). Each must name exactly one repository. An **Epic**, and any **Story or Spike that still holds child work**, are coordination containers and may span repos.

This invariant is enforced at four points: gate **S10** in the `*-validate-*` skills (write time), `task-decomposition` step 1.5 (PRD-decomposition time), **claim-time repo scoping** in the build-intake skills (when intake decides whether to claim a ready ticket for the current repo — see below), and the work-time split procedure below (when an agent picks up an existing ticket to implement it).

## Two splitting strategies, by phase

The strategy depends on whether the tickets exist yet. Do not mix them.

- **Decomposition-time (greenfield — no tickets exist yet).** Use `task-decomposition` step 1.5: create one work unit per repo and group them under a **parent Story** (the cross-repo coordination container). Children are per-repo; the parent stays cross-repo. This is the right shape when you are creating the tickets from a PRD in the first place.
- **Work-time (a ticket already exists and an agent is about to implement it).** Use the procedure below: keep the original ticket, **narrow it to one repo**, spin off a **sibling** per additional repo, and link them with a dependency. Do **not** invent a new parent Story — re-homing an in-flight ticket's hierarchy is more disruptive than narrowing it. The siblings inherit the original's existing parent (Epic/Story/Project) if it has one.

## Work-time split procedure

When an agent reads an existing leaf work unit at the pre-flight gate (before any code is written) and the work touches more than one repo, it must STOP and split before proceeding. This is an agent-performed fix, not a product question — like auto-transitioning status, auto-splitting a cross-repo work unit is explicitly allowed (S10 is `product_relevant: false`: a cross-repo work unit is a decomposition error the agent owns, not something to bounce to the reporter).

1. **Detect the repos.** Parse the description, acceptance criteria, and technical approach for repo references, and confirm against the actual code surfaces the change requires. If the work fits in one repo, proceed normally — no split.
2. **Pick the repo the original keeps.** Default: the original retains the **consumer / user-facing repo** (e.g. frontend), because that is usually the ticket a stakeholder is watching and the one whose acceptance criteria describe the user-visible outcome. Each **producer repo** (e.g. backend) becomes a new sibling.
3. **Create one sibling per additional repo, cloning the original's metadata.** Carry over: summary (re-prefixed `[repo-name]`), the three audience sections, priority, labels/components, parent (Epic/Story/Project) if the original has one, target backend environment, sign-in requirements, and a Validation Journey scoped to that repo. Scope the acceptance criteria to that repo only.
4. **Link by dependency.** The producer repo **blocks** the consumer repo (`is blocked by` on the consumer / `blocks` on the producer), so execution order is explicit: the producing sibling ships first. When there is no clear producer/consumer direction, use `relates to`.
5. **Narrow the original.** Edit its summary prefix, its `Repository` section, and its acceptance criteria down to the retained repo only. Remove every cross-repo reference ("and the backend should also…").
6. **Comment on the original.** Note the split and link each new sibling so the history is auditable.
7. **Re-validate.** Run `tracker-verify` (which runs S10) against the original and each new sibling. Every one must now PASS single-repo scope. If any still fails, the split was incomplete — fix it before proceeding.
8. **Proceed in dependency order.** Implement the producer sibling(s) first, then the consumer (the narrowed original), respecting the `blocks` links.

### When to block instead of split

Auto-split only when the split is unambiguous. Fall back to the standard BLOCK + reassign-to-reporter path (see the pre-flight gate in `base-rules`) when:

- The repos touched cannot be determined confidently from the ticket and the code.
- Splitting would strand stakeholder context that only the reporter can re-scope (e.g. the acceptance criteria describe a single indivisible cross-repo behavior with no clean per-repo boundary).
- The metadata required to clone (parent, environment, credentials) is itself missing — block on the missing metadata first; do not propagate gaps into the siblings.

## Claim-time repo scoping (build-intake)

A ticketing system can oversee multiple repos (one JIRA project / Linear team for `frontend`, `backend`, `infrastructure`). When `lisa:*-build-intake` runs inside one repo, it claims only tickets for **that** repo — it never pulls a ready ticket meant for a sibling repo. This is the fourth enforcement point of the single-repo-leaf invariant; it runs in each vendor build-intake's claim gate (Phase 3a), **before** the leaf-only container gate and the claim.

Resolve the current repo per the `config-resolution` "Repo scoping" section (config `repo` → `github.repo` → git remote basename; stop with a clear error if unresolvable). Then walk the ready candidates in priority order and apply the **repo-scope decision** to each before claiming:

1. **Read the candidate's repo marker** — the `repo:<name>` label (JIRA: also a component equal to a repo name).
   - **Labeled for another repo** → **skip** cheaply (do not claim, do not re-determine); it stays `ready` for that repo's own intake. Move to the next candidate.
   - **Labeled for the current repo** → proceed to the leaf-only gate + claim (the cheap, common path once labels exist).
   - **Unlabeled** → **determine** the target repo(s) from the ticket (description, acceptance criteria, technical approach) confirmed against the actual code surfaces the change requires — the same detection as step 1 of the work-time split. Then **stamp** the resolved `repo:<name>` label(s) so future cycles filter cheaply, and re-apply this decision with the now-known repo.
2. **Multi-repo leaf → split, never claim.** If determination finds the leaf touches more than one repo, run the **work-time split procedure** below to break it into single-repo siblings — each created **build-ready** (`build_ready: true`, so the build queue auto-claims it) and stamped with its own `repo:<name>`. After the split, the current repo's sibling (if any) becomes a normal current-repo candidate; the others are separate single-repo `ready` leaves for their repos. A multi-repo leaf is never claimed as-is.
3. **Wrong repo → skip.** A single-repo leaf whose `repo:<name>` ≠ the current repo is left `ready` (and labeled) and skipped; intake moves on until it finds a claimable current-repo leaf, then stops (one item per cycle).

**Cost.** Only **unlabeled** candidates need content determination; once stamped, wrong-repo candidates are skipped by label alone. Prefer candidates already labeled `repo:<current>` first (cheap claim), falling through to unlabeled candidates (determine + stamp) only when no pre-labeled current-repo leaf is ready.

A container (an Epic, or any item with open child work) is handled by the leaf-only gate, not here — containers may span repos, may keep multiple `repo:<name>` labels for visibility, and are never claimed/built directly. Only a leaf work unit — including a now-childless Story/Spike that the leaf-only gate treats as a leaf — is split or skipped by repo scope.

## Vendor mechanics

The procedure is vendor-neutral; the create + link + edit mechanics differ:

- **JIRA** — create via `mcp__atlassian__createJiraIssue` (clone fields, set the same epic parent); link via `mcp__atlassian__createIssueLink` with `Blocks` / `is blocked by` (resolve names via `mcp__atlassian__getIssueLinkTypes`); narrow the original via `mcp__atlassian__editJiraIssue`; comment via `mcp__atlassian__addCommentToJiraIssue`. See `jira-write-ticket` Phase 6.
- **GitHub** — create the sibling issue with the same labels and parent sub-issue; encode the dependency in the body (`Blocked by #<n>` / `Blocks #<n>`) and via the sub-issue/parent graph where used; edit the original's body to narrow scope. See `github-write-issue` Phase 6.
- **Linear** — create via `mcp__linear-server__save_issue` (clone fields, set the same `projectId`); add a blocking relation via the `relations` field or a paired relation call; edit the original to narrow scope. See `linear-write-issue` Phase 6.
