# Usage Accounting

Lisa usage accounting is a vendor-neutral contract for attaching AI usage and cost telemetry to the artifacts Lisa creates or updates. It governs the section shape, machine-readable tokens, source/pricing semantics, rollup behavior, and idempotent rewrite rules. Writer skills and lifecycle skills attach telemetry by following this contract; they do not invent artifact-local formats.

## Managed section

Artifacts that support inline body/description content use a single managed section:

```markdown
## Lisa Usage
```

The section is canonical. Rewrite it in place; never append a second usage section under a different heading. If an artifact host cannot safely edit the body, write the same section format in a comment instead and treat that comment body as the managed usage artifact for future rewrites.

The visible body is for humans; the hidden tokens are for machines. Both are required.

## Direct-entry schema

Each direct usage entry records one logical Lisa run or sub-run on one artifact. The required semantic fields are:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `entry_id` | Stable dedupe key for this logical usage entry. Unique within the artifact graph. |
| `flow` | `research`, `plan`, `implement`, `verify`, `debrief`, `intake`, `repair-intake`, `monitor`, or a command slug. |
| `run_id` | Runtime/session identifier when available; empty only when the runtime exposes no stable run id. |
| `provider` | Model provider name. |
| `model` | Model identifier. |
| `source` | `observed`, `estimated`, or `unavailable`. |
| `input_tokens` | Prompt/input tokens, or `null` when unavailable. |
| `cached_input_tokens` | Cached/reused input tokens, or `null` when unavailable/not exposed. |
| `output_tokens` | Output/completion tokens, or `null` when unavailable. |
| `reasoning_tokens` | Reasoning/internal tokens, or `null` when unavailable/not exposed. |
| `total_tokens` | Total trustworthy tokens for the entry, or `null`. |
| `cost` | Observed or estimated cost for this entry, or `null`. |
| `currency` | ISO currency code when `cost` is known, otherwise `null`. |
| `pricing_status` | `observed`, `estimated`, `missing`, or `unavailable`. |
| `pricing_source` | Runtime billing source, config/pricing snapshot ref, or `null`. |
| `artifact_ref` | Canonical ref of the artifact carrying the entry. |
| `parent_artifact_ref` | Canonical parent artifact ref when the entry is attached below a parent, otherwise empty. |

`entry_id` must be stable across rewrites of the same logical run. Rewriting an existing entry with the same `entry_id` updates it in place. A different run gets a different `entry_id` and is appended as a new direct entry.

## Source semantics

`source` describes how trustworthy the token counts are:

- `observed`: the runtime supplied the usage directly. Do not replace observed counts with estimates.
- `estimated`: Lisa derived counts or cost from trustworthy runtime metadata plus an explicit pricing contract. Estimates are allowed only when the derivation inputs are real and attributable to the run.
- `unavailable`: Lisa could not obtain trustworthy usage data. Write the entry anyway with `null` token/cost fields rather than silently omitting the row.

The absence of data is never treated as zero. `null` means unknown; `0` means explicitly observed or derived zero.

For example, an unavailable Verify run still records a direct entry with `source = unavailable`,
`pricing_status = unavailable`, and `null` token/cost fields so downstream readers can distinguish
"missing telemetry" from "zero usage."

## Pricing semantics

`pricing_status` describes how trustworthy the money fields are:

- `observed`: runtime supplied a trustworthy monetary cost.
- `estimated`: Lisa calculated cost from trustworthy token counts plus explicit pricing metadata.
- `missing`: token counts are known but no trustworthy price source exists yet.
- `unavailable`: the runtime exposed neither trustworthy cost nor enough trustworthy token data to estimate cost.

Runtime-observed cost always wins over estimates. Estimated cost never overwrites an observed value. Missing pricing preserves token counts and a `null` cost.

## Machine-readable tokens

Every visible direct entry row ends with exactly one machine-readable token:

```text
<!-- lisa:usage-entry entry_id=<id> flow=<flow> run_id=<run-id> provider=<provider> model=<model> source=<source> input_tokens=<n|null> cached_input_tokens=<n|null> output_tokens=<n|null> reasoning_tokens=<n|null> total_tokens=<n|null> cost=<decimal|null> currency=<code|null> pricing_status=<status> pricing_source=<ref|null> artifact_ref=<ref> parent_artifact_ref=<ref-or-empty> -->
```

Field order is fixed. A reader parses the usage ledger by matching `<!-- lisa:usage-entry ` lines only; it never needs to scrape prose or table cell positions. String fields are percent-encoded before rendering and decoded after parsing, so whitespace, commas, and HTML comment terminators inside source values cannot split or truncate the token.

Every managed section also ends with exactly one rollup token:

```text
<!-- lisa:usage-rollup direct_entry_ids=<csv> child_entry_ids=<csv> child_refs=<csv> direct_tokens=<n|null> child_tokens=<n|null> total_tokens=<n|null> direct_cost=<decimal|null> child_cost=<decimal|null> total_cost=<decimal|null> currency=<code|null> -->
```

- `direct_entry_ids` enumerates the entries attached directly to the current artifact.
- `child_entry_ids` enumerates deduped descendant entry ids included in the rollup.
- `child_refs` enumerates the child artifacts consulted for the rollup.
- `total_*` fields equal direct plus child totals over the deduped entry set.

The rollup token is the machine-readable summary. The visible rollup table mirrors it for humans. List fields are comma-delimited after encoding each item independently; commas inside an item are encoded as data, not treated as separators.

## Visible rendering contract

The canonical body layout is:

```markdown
## Lisa Usage

_Managed by Lisa. Regenerated on each usage update; do not edit by hand._

### Direct Usage

| Flow | Model | Source | Tokens | Cost |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|
| ...human-readable rows ending with `lisa:usage-entry` tokens... |

### Rollup

| Scope | Tokens | Cost |
|---|---:|---:|
| Direct | ... | ... |
| Child | ... | ... |
| Total | ... | ... |

<!-- lisa:usage-rollup ... -->
```

Writers may add host-specific surrounding prose, but they must preserve the heading, the managed-note line, the direct-entry tokens, and the single rollup token.

## Rollup and dedupe behavior

Rollups aggregate descendant usage from native tracker hierarchy, documented generated-work references, and explicit `parent_artifact_ref` links. Within one artifact rollup:

- Dedupe strictly by stable `entry_id`.
- Count each `entry_id` at most once even if the same descendant is discoverable through more than one path.
- Preserve direct totals separately from child totals.
- Exclude descendant entries whose `entry_id` is already present in the artifact's direct-entry set.

Concrete example: if child artifact A and child artifact B both surface descendant entry
`verify-123`, the parent rollup lists `verify-123` once in `child_entry_ids`. If the parent also
records `verify-123` directly, exclude that descendant copy from child totals and keep the entry in
the direct half only.

The rollup contract is additive across the hierarchy: PRDs may roll up Epics/Stories/leaves, and leaves may roll up evidence or verification artifacts, without double counting shared descendants.

## Idempotent rewrite rules

- There is exactly one managed `## Lisa Usage` section per artifact body/comment.
- Recompute the entire section on every write; never append ad hoc rows.
- Sort direct entries deterministically by `(flow, run_id, entry_id)`.
- Preserve existing entries with unchanged `entry_id` and refreshed field values.
- Re-running with the same logical entry set must produce byte-identical output.
- Do not include timestamps in the section preamble or token lines.

Idempotency is enforced by `entry_id` for direct entries and by the fixed rollup token field order for totals.
