/**
 * Prove that a third-party review either RAN at the head commit, or that a
 * local adversarial review was posted in its place (issue #3591).
 *
 * @remarks
 * ## The measurement this exists for
 *
 * A third-party review app posts a **commit status** on the pull request head.
 * When it is throttled, or declines to review at all, it still reports
 * `state: success` — it never blocks. Only the status `description`
 * distinguishes a review that ran from one that never started.
 *
 * Re-measured over the last 30 merged pull requests in this repository, reading
 * the reviewer's status on each pull request's head SHA:
 *
 * ```
 * success :: Review rate limited                                       19
 * success :: Review completed                                           6
 * success :: Review skipped: manual review required for this OSS repo    5
 * ```
 *
 * **24 of 30 merges passed a required review gate that reviewed nothing.** A
 * second repository sampled `success` on 50 of 50 and contributed a fourth
 * string, `Review skipped: NNN files exceed the limit of NNN`.
 *
 * ## Allowlist of ONE, fail closed
 *
 * Only a description the project declared as its reviewed-when phrase counts as
 * evidence a review happened. Anything else — throttled, skipped, absent,
 * empty, or a string nobody has seen before — means NOT REVIEWED.
 *
 * A denylist of known-bad phrases fails OPEN, and the vocabulary is open-ended:
 * four distinct strings are known already, from two repositories, and the vendor
 * decorates them at will. An unrecognised string must cost an extra local
 * review, never a free pass. `EVIDENCE_DEFAULTS.no_work` is therefore consulted
 * ONLY to word the explanation, and never to reach the verdict.
 *
 * ## The rollup cannot see this
 *
 * `gh pr view --json statusCheckRollup` returns a `StatusContext` entry with NO
 * `description` key at all — verified:
 *
 * ```json
 * {"__typename":"StatusContext","context":"…","state":"SUCCESS","targetUrl":""}
 * ```
 *
 * Hollow green is invisible there. The evidence read MUST come from
 * `repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits/{sha}/status` and use `.statuses[].description`.
 *
 * ## A review OBJECT is not a status CONTEXT
 *
 * An empty-bodied `APPROVED` review is an ordinary human approval, not hollow.
 * Empty-body reasoning belongs to status descriptions and must never leak onto
 * review objects — `classifyReviewObject` exists to keep the two apart. A
 * `CHANGES_REQUESTED` is a blocking objection whatever its body, because its
 * content commonly lives entirely in inline threads.
 *
 * ## Never re-request a review to refresh it
 *
 * Re-requesting OVERWRITES the existing status rather than adding to it. Under
 * a throttle that destroys a real review, one-way. Nothing here posts a review
 * request, and nothing downstream should add one.
 *
 * ## No reviewer configured is a FIRST-CLASS state
 *
 * Not every project uses a third-party reviewer. An absent or empty reviewer
 * list is a no-op that SAYS it is a no-op. A silent pass is the exact defect
 * this module exists to end, so it is not reproduced here.
 *
 * CLI:
 *   node scripts/check-third-party-review-evidence.mjs --sha <sha> [--json]
 *     [--context <context>] [--root <dir>] [--repo <owner/repo>]
 *
 * `--context` names the status context that woke the run. When it is given and
 * belongs to no declared reviewer, the run is an explicit no-op: a status from
 * some other app cannot change this answer, and evaluating on one would report
 * a reviewer as absent merely because it had not posted yet.
 *
 * @module scripts/check-third-party-review-evidence
