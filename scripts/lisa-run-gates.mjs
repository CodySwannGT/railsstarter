/**
 * Run the gates declared at one moment, and say exactly what ran.
 *
 * The git hooks used to hardcode both the tool and the list of steps, which
 * meant the answer to "what does this project prove before a commit?" lived in
 * a shell script that only a shell could read. This runner asks the registry
 * instead: the project declares gates in `.lisa.config.json`, `lisa-gates.mjs`
 * resolves which ones apply at a moment, and this file executes them.
 *
 * ## Green is not proof
 *
 * The defect this subsystem exists to prevent is a check reporting satisfied
 * without having proved anything, so three things are non-negotiable here:
 *
 * - An `optional` gate that FAILS prints as FAILED. It does not block, and it
 *   is not swallowed. "Optional" governs the response, never the verdict.
 * - When a required gate fails, the cheap gates behind it still run and the
 *   COSTLY ones print as NOT RUN with their verdict called UNKNOWN. What would
 *   be new — and wrong — is letting an unrun gate look proved, or letting it
 *   look like a gate that had nothing to run.
 * - A gate that resolves to no command is UNPROVABLE, not passing. Nothing
 *   executed, so nothing was proved, whatever its level says.
 * - A FAILED gate says WHICH failure it was, and WHOSE it was. `exit 1` is the
 *   same sentence for a coverage regression and for a subprocess starved past
 *   its timeout, and when two opposite facts share a sentence the cheaper
 *   response — re-run — is the rational one for both, so the real regression is
 *   never looked at. A gate that merely SHARES the failing prover reports
 *   UNPROVABLE rather than FAILED: it blocks, and it stops claiming a
 *   measurement that never happened.
 *
 * ## Exit codes are the hook's control flow
 *
 * The hooks fall back to their hardcoded steps unless this runner positively
 * reports a verdict, so "the runner could not run" must never look like "all
 * gates passed". Hence `NO_GATES` and `RUNNER_FAILED` are distinct from
 * `PROVED`, and the hook routes each one deliberately.

 *

 * property omitted from these lists is one whose step always runs.
 *
 * `structural-rules` is on the commit list because `.lintstagedrc.json` runs

 * Diagnoses under which the command established nothing about any property.

 *
 * `undiagnosed` is the one that was measured in the wild
 * (CodySwannGT/lisa#2961). A coverage run lost its own scratch files to a
 * second coverage run in the same directory and died on a bare `ENOENT`. The
 * classifier got it right — it printed **"no recognised failure signature"**,
 * which is an admission — and the runner then rendered that admission as
 * `FAILED required coverage-adequacy`. So the report said, in one line, both
 * "I do not know what happened" and "the coverage floor was not met". The
 * second half was invented, and it is the half an operator acts on.
 *
 * `interference` is the same event as that `undiagnosed` one, now recognised
 * and named rather than merely admitted — recognising it must not silently
 * promote it back to a measurement.
 *
 * ## Two kinds that look eligible and are not
 *
 * `uncaptured` is NOT here, and the attempt to include it is what proves the
 * distinction. Capture is on by default (`LISA_GATES_CAPTURE=0` turns it off),
 * so `uncaptured` is an explicit loss of diagnostic evidence rather than the
 * ordinary outcome. A gate that exited nonzero did measure something; the
 * runner merely did not keep the transcript. Missing evidence about a real
 * failure is not the same claim as a captured transcript that describes no
 * failure at all, which is what `undiagnosed` means.
 *
 * `killed` IS here, and it arrived last (CodySwannGT/lisa#3032). #2813 gave a
 * terminated gate the right SENTENCE — "It was terminated, NOT failed" — and
 * left it printing the FAILED token beside that sentence, so the prose and the
 * vocabulary disagreed and only the prose was right. A kill is the purest case
 * this set describes: the command never answered, so there is no measurement to
 * report. It is the one member that does not render as UNPROVABLE, because a
 * reader who needs to know the box killed the run should not have to infer it
 * from a word that also covers a sibling gate's failure — see `stateFor`.
 *
 * Nothing about blocking changes. UNPROVABLE is counted in `result.failed` and
 * sets `blockedBy` exactly as FAILED does — an unmeasured required property is
 * not a pass. The only thing that changes is that the gate stops naming a cause
 * it does not have.

 * ## Why this is not `coveredFloor`
 *
 * `--coverage` is read by a shell hook that stands its own built-in step down

 * property is somebody's job" when the hook reads it as "this property is
 * done", and those diverge the moment a leg errors.
 *
 * Measured, on a real push: an OPTIONAL gate ran, exited nonzero, and was
 * classified UNPROVABLE. `blocked` is set only by a REQUIRED gate going
 * unproved, so the run was not blocked and the runner exited 0 — while the
 * coverage file, written before the gate ever ran, already named it. The hook
 * saw exit 0 and a matching line, printed "Covered by the type-correctness
 * gate; the built-in type check stands down", and allowed the push. The type
 * check ran at NEITHER layer and the exit code was success. A declared gate
 * became a quieter way of turning a check off than declaring it `off`, which is
 * the one thing this subsystem exists to refuse.
 *
 * ## What still counts as covered
 *
 * A gate declared `off` never reaches `resolveMoment` (which drops `off`
 * unless asked for it), so it is in `declared`, absent from `result.results`,
 * and stays covered. That is deliberate and unchanged: `off` is a decision on
 * the record, and the built-in standing down is that decision taking effect.
 *
 * A SKIPPED gate keeps its coverage too — its verdict IS established, there was
 * nothing to run here. (`await` mode is the arguable member of that bucket:
 * `unconfiguredAt` in lisa-gates.mjs reads an awaited gate as proving nothing
 * locally, so the two files disagree about it. That divergence predates this
 * function and is deliberately left alone here — it is a design question about
 * whether a CI signal may retire a local step, not the errored-leg defect.)

 * One gate's outcome: `EVIDENCE_FIELDS` verbatim, plus exactly two additions.

 * All seven `EVIDENCE_FIELDS` keys are spelled exactly as that module declares

 * the release verifier's requirements and this producer's too:
 *
 * - `level` — without a per-row level, a required gate can be "covered" by
 *   evidence that was OPTIONAL when it ran, which is a silent downgrade. Here
 *   it is also the only thing that tells a reader whether a failing gate was
 *   allowed to fail.
 * - `label` — the registry label, which ties the row to the branch-protection
 *   context `contextsFor` derives, so an audit can name the context and not
 *   only the gate id.
 *
 * Nothing else. `task` and `command` deliberately do NOT get their own row
 * keys: they are inside `contract.gates_digest`, and a second copy on the row
 * is a second place to drift. The command still appears once, as
 * `prover.tool`, which is an `EVIDENCE_FIELDS` key.
 *
 * `prover.version` is null rather than `"unknown"` when unresolvable. A string
 * that looks like a version and is a placeholder is worse than an absent
 * field, because a placeholder defeats the check that reads it.
 *
 * NARROWED for #3013, and the narrowing matters. This comment used to say
 * flatly that the verifier treats a null-version row as uncoverable. Read
 * literally that makes NOTHING reusable, because the pull-request producer
 * cannot resolve a version for every hand-written job. The rule is right for
 * the case it was written about and too broad for the rest, so `reusePlan` in
 * lisa-gates.mjs applies it by reuse class: for a TIME-SENSITIVE gate the
 * prover is an external scanner whose version decides what it can find, and a
 * null version is disqualifying; for a DETERMINISTIC gate the binding that
 * matters is `subject.tree` + `contract.gates_digest` + `contract.workflow_sha`,
 * all non-null by construction, and a null `prover.version` weakens nothing.
 *
 * `work` is null and stays null until a prover-output parser exists. That is
 * not a shortcut: `readEvidence` demotes a `pass` with no work count to
 * `unknown` for any gate whose registry entry names one, so the conservative
 * value fails SAFE. A fabricated count would fail the other way.

  // which command they happened to run (CodySwannGT/lisa#3042). The instance

  // the runner declines to execute is a silent skip reporting green, which is
  // the defect this whole subsystem exists to refuse.

  // The rules are NOT restated here. `configurationProblems` is the one reading
  // of legality and `validate` is its other caller, so a rule added there binds
