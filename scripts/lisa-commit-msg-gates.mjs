/**
 * @file Name every gate family that runs at the commit-msg moment.
 *
 * ## The defect this removes
 *
 * More than one INDEPENDENT gate family bites at `commit-msg`, and until this
 * file existed only one of them introduced itself. `lisa-work-item.mjs` prints
 * a five-gate checklist on any traceability refusal — deliberately scoped to
 * the traceability contract, which is the only contract it owns. At the same
 * moment the hook also runs commitlint and an AI co-authorship check, and
 * neither said so until it fired. An operator could satisfy every requirement
 * the checklist named and still be refused, twice, for reasons nothing had
 * mentioned. Measured: two sessions in one day each cleared the named gates and
 * were bounced by the co-authorship trailer.
 *
 * ## Why it is a third file rather than a sixth line
 *
 * The obvious fix — append the co-authorship gate to `gateSummary` — was
 * rejected upstream and the reasoning is worth keeping. `gateSummary` lives in
 * `lisa-work-item.mjs`, which does not own the co-authorship check, cannot
 * verify it, and cannot know whether a given host project installs it. A
 * checklist that confidently names a gate a project does not have is worse than
 * one that stays silent, for the same reason the traceability checklist reads
 * role names from the resolved contract instead of hardcoding Lisa's defaults.
 * And folding an unrelated family into a list headed "All five gates" makes the
 * count wrong in a new direction, which is the precise defect that list exists
 * to remove.
 *
 * So this module is owned by neither check. It answers one question — what runs
 * at commit-msg in THIS project — and both families call it on refusal.
 *
 * ## Why the answer is read off the hook rather than declared
 *
 * The families are detected from the INVOCATIONS in the project's own
 * `commit-msg` hook: `validate-commit`, `commitlint --edit`, the co-authorship
 * `grep`. That is the file that is doing the refusing, so it is the only
 * honest authority on what a commit here must survive.
 *
 * A marker comment the hook declares would read more cleanly and was the first
 * design. It fails on the case that matters: a host that deletes a block keeps
 * whatever the block was declared to be somewhere else, and an installed hook
 * predating the marker declares nothing at all — so the summary would either
 * name a gate that no longer runs or name none of them. Detecting the call
 * degrades the right way in both directions.
 *
 * Every candidate hook path is read and the results unioned, because "the
 * commit-msg hook" is not one path: husky 8 points git straight at
 * `.husky/commit-msg`, husky 9 interposes `.husky/_/commit-msg`, and a project
 * using neither has `.git/hooks/commit-msg`. Reading only the one git invoked
 * would answer "no families" for the husky 9 shim, which contains no gate at
 * all.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   lisa-commit-msg-gates.mjs list [--hook <path>] [--refused <family-id>]
 *
 * Always exits 0. This runs only on a refusal that has already decided to fail
 * the commit; it must never be the reason a commit is refused, and it must
 * never turn a refusal into a crash.

 *
 * `detect` matches the ENFORCING invocation, never prose. The co-authorship
 * block in particular carries a long comment that names the trailer it checks
 * for; a project that deleted the check and left the comment would still be
 * told the gate runs, which is the failure this whole file exists to remove.
 *
 * `id` is the registry gate id where the registry has one. `ai-coauthorship`
 * has none — no declaration in `.lisa.config.json` governs it — and that is
 * recorded here rather than papered over with an invented name.
