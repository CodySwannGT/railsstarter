/**
 * Threshold ratchet gate — quality thresholds may tighten, never weaken.
 *
 * Deterministic comparator shared by three enforcement layers:
 *   1. Agent-time soft block: PostToolUse hook via threshold-ratchet.sh
 *      (`--hook`, exit 2 on weakening so the agent gets actionable feedback).
 *   2. Pre-commit backstop: husky / lefthook (`--staged`, exit 1).
 *   3. CI gate: reusable quality workflows (`--base <ref>`, exit 1),
 *      comparing against the merge-base so nothing weakened lands in a PR.
 *
 * Tier 1 — designed tunables: vitest/jest/simplecov/e2e thresholds
 * (minimums) and eslint/rubocop thresholds (maximums). Tier 2 — stryker's
 * break score and k6 expression bounds. Tier 3 — exemption additions
 * (stryker mutate exclusions, thresholdRatchet.allow entries) which weaken
 * a gate without touching a number. Audit ignore lists are deliberately NOT
 * watched: the security-audit-handling ladder authorizes agents to add
 * documented entries autonomously, and doctor readiness (B5) audits that
 * every entry carries a written decision.
 *
 * Human override: `.lisa.config.json` → `thresholdRatchet.allow` entries
 * ({ file, key, reason, until }). Honored ONLY from the baseline side (HEAD /
 * merge-base), never from the change under review — an agent cannot grant
 * itself an exception in the same change that weakens a gate. `key: "*"`
 * allows every key in the file, and reports as file-wide so it is not mistaken
 * for a key-scoped one.
 *
 * Exemptions END (#3856). `until` is a `YYYY-MM-DD` day the entry is live
 * through; past it the entry stops exempting and the weakening it permitted is
 * refused again, naming the entry, its scope, its reason and the remedy. An
 * entry naming no evaluable condition still exempts — that keeps a project
 * mid-migration off a red wall — but is reported on every run until somebody
 * gives it a condition or deletes it. Modelled on `_thresholdsDivergence` in
 * `stryker.conf.json`, the sibling exemption that already stops exempting when
 * it goes stale; see `threshold-ratchet-families.mjs` `ALLOW_STATE`.
 *
 * One exception, and only one: a PROMOTION between deploy-chain branches
 * (`--base` + `--head`, both named in `deploy.branches`, head upstream of
 * base, head fully containing base). There the allow list is read from the
 * head, because the change under review is the baseline plus history that has
 * already passed this same gate. See `isPromotion` for why that is the only
 * discriminator that holds.
 *
 * Extraction lives in threshold-ratchet-families.mjs; comparison rules in
 * threshold-ratchet-compare.mjs. Zero dependencies.

/**
 * Standard git locations, checked in order so the executable comes from a

 * fallback keeps unusual layouts (e.g. Windows git-bash) working.
 *
 * Order within that constraint is set by measurement, not by convention. On
 * macOS `/usr/bin/git` is not git: it is Apple's `xcrun` shim, which locates a
 * developer directory and re-executes the real binary there. Dispatching
 * through it costs a **median 33 ms against 15 ms** for either
 * developer-directory git, and **100 ms against 21 ms at p90** — randomized
 * call order, fixed inter-call gaps, `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`, n=30 each
 * (lisa#2898). The call does no work at all; the difference is the dispatch.
 *
 * The two entries promoted ahead of it are the developer-directory gits the
 * shim itself re-executes. Both are `root:wheel` files in system locations, so
 * this is the same trust class as `/usr/bin/git` and not a relaxation: the
 * user-writable `/usr/local` and Homebrew entries stay behind it, exactly where
 * they already were. Neither promoted path exists on Linux, so every CI runner
