/**
 * Say WHICH thing failed, from a failed gate's own output.
 *
 * ## Why a bare exit code is a defect and not just terse
 *
 * `coverage-adequacy — bun run test:cov (exit 1)` is the same sentence whether
 * the suite measured 84% against a floor of 86%, or whether four
 * subprocess-heavy tests were starved of CPU and hit their wall-clock budget
 * while every assertion in the run passed. Those are opposite facts: one is a
 * regression that must block, the other is the machine being busy.
 *
 * Measured across six sightings, every one was the second kind — always a
 * timeout, never a coverage number below threshold — and every one was
 * answered by a retry, because re-running is genuinely cheaper than
 * investigating a bare exit code. That reflex is rational, and it is also why a
 * real coverage regression would currently be invisible: it renders as the same
 * line the operator has been trained to re-run.
 *
 * ## Precedence: an incomplete run is not a measurement
 *
 * A run whose tests timed out still prints coverage numbers, and those numbers
 * will be low, because the code the dead tests would have exercised went
 * unexercised. Reading a threshold error off such a run reports the *effect* of
 * the timeout as though it were the cause. So a timeout outranks a threshold
 * reading, and a failed assertion outranks it too — coverage is only a
 * measurement when the suite that produced it finished.

 * runs, identical except for what was done to the directory at the eight-second

 * | removed and **left absent** | `Something removed the coverage directory "…" … not running multiple Vitests with the same "coverage.reportsDirectory" at the same time` |
 *
 * The provider's own explanation is guarded on the directory being ABSENT. A
 * second coverage run in the same directory removes it and re-creates it in
 * consecutive statements, so by the time the first run looks, the directory is
 * back and the guard does not fire. **The one case the message was written for
 * is the one case it cannot reach**, and what reaches the operator instead is a
 * bare `ENOENT` on a path nobody recognises — which is how it arrived at
 * CodySwannGT/lisa#2961 filed as a coverage-gate failure.
 *
 * ## What this is NOT
 *
 * It is not stale debris. Seeded with 798 abandoned scratch files from a killed
 * run — the largest holding measured in the wild — a coverage run completes and
 * reports a verdict, because the provider deletes that directory before every

 *
 * Measured on the reproduction: the file does not parse. ESLint reports
 * `Parsing error: ';' expected` and runs **zero** rules on it; `oxlint` and
 * vite's oxc transform report a parse error too. A rule that lives inside a
 * parser is therefore absent in exactly the case that motivates it. Lexing the
 * lines needs no parse and so still works on the wreckage.

/**
 * The verdict for a transcript carrying a failure shape the project declared.
 *
 * ## Why the shapes come from OUTSIDE this module
 *
 * Everything above this function recognises a fixed set of transcript forms,
 * and every content signature among them is a vitest or `tsc` form. A prover
 * that prints anything else falls into the residual bucket wearing
 * `UNPROVABLE` — the word this fleet reads as *"the box, re-run it somewhere
 * quieter"* — so a run that genuinely measured a property and found it wanting
 * is routed into the re-run path.
 *
 * The tempting repair is one more entry in the table. It does not converge:
 * every project points its gates at provers this module has never seen, so
 * each new one re-introduces the defect once and the cost is paid by whoever
 * hits it first. Measured on one repository (CodySwannGT/lisa#3974), four
 * distinct provers hit it — and a Lisa-repo-specific pattern in a module every
 * consumer installs is the same objection that keeps a Lisa-repo-specific gate
 * out of the shipped registry.
 *
 * So the project that owns the prover says how its output reads as measured,
 * and this module carries the MECHANISM and none of the vocabulary. Nothing
 * below names a tool, a script, or an artifact.
 *
 * ## Why the shapes are literal substrings and not patterns
 *
 * A declaration is untrusted input compiled from configuration, and this
 * function parses a multi-megabyte transcript inside a git hook. A regular
 * expression from config would be an operator-authored ReDoS with a
 * transcript-sized haystack — see `SCRATCH_REMOVAL_RACE` and `PATH_DELIMITER`
 * for how carefully this module already avoids that shape in patterns it wrote
 * itself. A literal substring cannot backtrack, needs no escaping, and is what
 * an operator copying a line out of a failed transcript would write anyway.
 *
 * ## Why this is consulted separately rather than folded into `classify`
 *
 * The runner calls it ONLY when the shipped classifier has already returned
 * `undiagnosed`. That placement is the whole safety argument: a killed,
 * refused, interfered-with or zero-test run never reaches a content signature
 * at all, so a declaration cannot promote non-measurement into a failure. The
 * guarantee is structural rather than a matter of where a line was inserted.
 * @param {string|null|undefined} output The command's combined output.
 * @param {Array<{gate: string, shape: string[]}>|null|undefined} declarations
 *   What each gate sharing this prover declared its failure looks like.
 * @returns {Diagnosis|null} The verdict, or null when nothing declared matched.

 *   when the runner could not capture it.
 * @param {number|null|undefined} [code] The command's exit code. Omitted by a

 *   only legible in the exit code and never in the output.
 * @param {LoadReading|null} [load] The machine's load, for a kill's evidence
 *   line. Defaults to reading this machine; pass `null` to suppress the line,
 *   or a fixed reading to make the output deterministic.
 * @param {(path: string) => string|null} [read] Reads a source file the
 *   transcript named, returning null when it cannot be read. Defaults to the
 *   real filesystem; injected by tests so a fixture needs no files on disk.
 * @param {TempRootReading|null} [tempRoot] The shared temp root's population,
 *   for a timeout's evidence line. OMIT to measure this machine — but the
 *   measurement is taken lazily, only on the timeout path that consumes it.
 *   Pass `null` to suppress the line, or a fixed reading to make output
 *   deterministic.
 *
 *   This is deliberately NOT a default parameter. A default is evaluated on
 *   every call that omits the argument, so `tempRoot = tempRootPopulation()`
 *   ran a `readdirSync` plus a `statSync` over the shared temp root for every
 *   assertion failure, coverage miss and kill — none of which use the reading.
 *   On a box whose temp root holds tens of thousands of entries that is not
 *   free, and the irony is total: this was added by the change about temp-root
 *   churn. Nothing in the suite could catch it, because cost is not asserted.
 *
 *   Making the default lazier does NOT work, and that is the trap: a default
 *   parameter cannot distinguish OMITTED from EXPLICITLY NULL, because both
 *   arrive as `undefined`/`null` at different points and only `undefined`
 *   triggers a default. `null` is the documented suppression that keeps test
 *   output deterministic, so it must survive. Hence the resolution moved to
 *   the single consuming call site, where the two are still distinguishable.
