/**
 * Run one shell command in a process boundary and reap every descendant.
 *
 * Node's synchronous timeout signals only the direct child. A gate command is
 * a tree (shell, package manager, test workers), so killing only the shell
 * leaves descendants running against scratch state the caller then removes.
 * This small asynchronous supervisor is invoked through a synchronous parent:
 * it owns the process-group id, applies the deadline, terminates the group, and
 * only then lets the parent continue. On Windows, the common PowerShell helper
 * owns a native Job Object because a shell PID cannot identify descendants
 * after the shell exits. Windows 10 / Server 2016 or newer and the installed
 * Windows PowerShell execution policy must permit that helper; startup failure
 * rejects the command without an uncontained fallback.
 *
 * ## Interrupting a run
 *
 * The deadline was never the only way a run ends early. An operator — or an
 * agent told to free a contended machine — kills the gate runner, and because
 * this supervisor holds the ONLY handle to the detached group it started,
 * killing its parent used to leave it reparented to pid 1 with the whole tree
 * still executing. Measured: the kill reported success, `pgrep` for the runner
 * returned nothing, and eleven processes carried on (CodySwannGT/lisa#3829).
 *
 * So the supervisor watches for the run it serves going away, tears the tree
 * down through the same single reap the deadline uses, and SAYS SO. A silent
 * teardown would be the same defect wearing a different face: the operator who
 * asked for the run to stop cannot tell a stop from a survival either way.
