/**
 * The gate registry: what Lisa guarantees, and where each guarantee is proved.
 *
 * A **gate is a property**, not a tool. `gitleaks` is not a gate — *credential
 * leakage* is the gate, and gitleaks is one way to prove it. Catalogued as
 * tools, one guarantee appears three times under three names and nobody can see
 * that a fourth is missing; catalogued as properties, "which guarantees rest on
 * a single mechanism" has an answer.
 *
 * **Lisa owns the vocabulary; the project owns the implementation.** Lisa says
 * "prove credential leakage"; the project says what that means by naming one of
 * its own tasks. Swapping gitleaks for trufflehog changes one line of project
 * config and nothing in Lisa.
 *
 * ## One axis: the moment
 *
 * A gate declares *when* it runs. Not *where* — the surface a session is on is
 * detected, not declared, and asking someone to restate it in config is how you
 * end up with `local`/`remote` in one subsystem and five real surfaces in
 * another. What a gate needs in order to run is expressed as `needs`, and the
 * surface falls out of wherever that moment happens to occur.
 *
 * `needs` is TWO fields wearing one name, split by who can honestly know the
 * answer. A project declares `tools` and `secrets`, because those describe the
 * prover IT named and Lisa has never seen it. The registry declares `deps`,
 * because that describes the prover LISA wrote — see the field's own comment
 * below. For as long as this sentence was written and no registry entry had a
 * `needs`, the promise was true of one half only; the split is what makes it
 * true of both.
 *
 * ## Two proof modes
 *
 * `run` executes a task and reads its exit code. `await` watches for an
 * external signal — a review bot, a SAST service — and reads its verdict. Which
 * applies is the project's choice, not the gate's: Snyk can be a CLI you run or
 * an app that reports. A gate may use different modes at different moments,
 * which is the normal shape for code review: an agentic review before push, a
 * bot on the pull request.
 *
 * ## Green is not proof
 *
 * The defect this design is organised against is a check reporting satisfied
 * without having proved anything. It has two forms and both are handled here.
 *
 * A required `CodeRabbit` context posted `success` with the description
 * "Review rate limited", having reviewed nothing, on two security-relevant pull
 * requests that then merged. That is the `await` form, caught by description.
 *
 * `passWithNoTests: true` USED TO ship in five stack configs, so a unit-test
 * gate could report green having run zero tests. That is the `run` form, caught
 * by a work count. No description is involved and no vendor is at fault.
 *
 * That flag is gone as of #2603 — from the configs AND from the six
 * `--passWithNoTests` CLI arguments in four package templates, which overrode
 * the configs and were the channel most consumers actually ran. The example is
 * kept in the past tense rather than deleted: it is the clearest instance of
 * the `run` form anyone has produced, and a reader needs to know what shape to
 * look for, not merely that one instance was fixed.
 *
 * The response is configurable, with one exception. You may configure whether
 * to stop; you may not configure it into having been proved. A hollow result is
 * recorded as unproved in every mode, or `on_hollow: report` becomes a way to
 * launder an unreviewed merge.

 * Why an `await:` cannot be kept at this moment, or null when it can.
 *
 * ## The gap this closes (#4046)
 *
 * A gate declared `required` at `pre-deploy:<env>` with an `await:` was
 * ACCEPTED by `validate`, SKIPPED by the only executor that moment has, and
 * REPORTED GREEN. Reproduced from an injected config at `origin/main`
 * `8f4d34016`:
 *
 *     🚦 Gates at pre-deploy:production:
 *       SKIPPED  required runtime-web-vulnerability  awaits "External DAST App"; no signal exists locally
 *     ✅ pre-deploy:production: 0 proved, 0 failed (optional), ... exit 0
 *
 * The release the gate was declared to hold proceeds and nothing says the gate
 * proved nothing — the exact failure this subsystem exists to prevent, sited at
 * the one moment family with no comparison surface watching it.
 *
 * ## FAMILY, NOT THE RAW KEY — the whole reason this is a function
 *
 * Both former call sites tested `NO_STATUS_MOMENTS.includes(moment)`, and the
 * key under test at a deploy moment is `pre-deploy:production`, not
 * `pre-deploy`. So the obvious fix — adding the family names to that array —
 * refuses nothing. MEASURED TWICE: once by the agent on #3650, whose 14
 * assertions all stayed green while the source appeared to implement the
 * refusal, and again here, where the same mutation left this file's own suite
 * at an unchanged `11 failed | 6 passed` and the live reproduction still
 * printing `✅ ... exit 0`. A fix written that way passes its own review and
 * governs nothing, which is why the comparison is `momentFamily(moment)` and
 * why it lives in ONE named function rather than at each site.
 *
 * `momentFamily` is identity on the fixed moments, so the pre-pull-request set
 * keeps matching exactly as it did.
 *
 * ## TWO REASONS, BECAUSE ONE OF THEM WOULD BE A LIE
 *
 * `push` is refused with "there is no pull request yet". At a deploy moment
 * that sentence is FALSE — a deploy has a commit, and normally a merged pull
 * request behind it — and an operator who reads it concludes the declaration
 * will start working once the branch merges, which is the opposite of the
 * truth. The deploy families are refused for their own reason: the derivation
 * is fine and there is no CONSUMER. Verified against `origin/main` rather than
 * assumed — an awaited context has one enforcement consumer,
 * `lisa-reconcile-policy.mjs`, which writes required status checks onto a
 * BRANCH RULESET (its `moment` defaults to `pull-request`), and a branch
 * ruleset governs a merge, never a deploy.
 *
 * ## Each family answered, not generalised from `pre-deploy`
 *
 * `post-deploy` and `continuous` reach the same answer by the same argument and
 * are named here rather than inherited: neither has a ruleset, neither has a
 * pull request in flight, and `continuous` runs on a schedule against a stable
 * target, so it has no diff and nothing to attach a status to at all.
 *
 * @param {string} moment The moment key, environment suffix and all.
 * @returns {string|null} The reason an awaited signal cannot be kept, or null.

/**
 * The per-moment field saying how this gate's prover prints a MEASURED failure.
 *
 * `gate-failure-diagnosis.mjs` recognises a fixed set of transcript forms, and
 * every content signature among them is a vitest or `tsc` form. A prover that
 * prints anything else lands in the residual bucket wearing `UNPROVABLE` — the
 * word this fleet reads as "the box, re-run it" — so a run that measured a
 * property and found it wanting is routed into the re-run path
 * (CodySwannGT/lisa#3974).
 *
 * Enumerating other tools' output in the shipped module cannot converge: every
 * project points its gates at provers Lisa has never seen. So the project that
 * OWNS the prover declares how its failure reads, beside the `run:` that names
 * the prover.
 *
 * ## Why per MOMENT and not per gate
 *
 * The first draft put it on the gate, reasoning that output shape is a
 * property of the prover. Two facts overruled that, and the second is the one
 * with consequences.
 *
 * **A gate's prover already varies by moment.** `code-style` runs `lint:staged`
 * at commit and `lint` at pull-request here; the first prints lint-staged's
 * `✖ <task>` banner and the second does not. A gate-level shape would assert
 * one prover's vocabulary for both.
 *
 * **The gate level is a CLOSED allowlist and the moment level is open.**
 * `GATE_FIELDS` is exhaustive, so an older Lisa refuses any gate-level key it
 * does not know — and refuses the WHOLE gates block with it. Measured against
 * the packaged resolver this repository's own quality facade resolves first:
 *
 * ```
 * Invalid gates configuration:
 *   gates."code-style"."failure_shape" is not a moment Lisa knows.
 * ```
 *
 * Every facade then reads `configured=false` and falls through to built-in
 * behaviour, so declaring a shape would silently un-configure every job in the
 * repository until the pin caught up. A moment entry's extra keys are ignored
 * by an older validator instead, which makes the declaration inert there
 * rather than destructive. Inert-until-upgraded is the safe direction; every
 * other per-moment field (`await`, `posted_by`, `evidence`, `caller_chain`)
 * already lives with the same property.
 *
 * The value is a list of literal substrings, not patterns. A regular
 * expression from configuration would be an operator-authored ReDoS run
 * against a multi-megabyte transcript inside a git hook, and a literal is what
 * somebody copying a line out of a failed transcript writes anyway.
 */

 * The per-declaration field naming the job chain this gate's prover sits under.
 *
 * A gate whose prover lives OUTSIDE the quality facade cannot state its own

 * label with the chain of jobs that reach the facade, and that chain is a fact
 * about the CALLER, not about the gate. When a project proves one property
 * from a workflow of its own, the caller-wide chain describes a route that
 * never reaches that gate's prover, and the derived name is one nothing posts.
 *
 * Declared per MOMENT, never once for the whole gate, because the chain is a
 * property of one moment's wiring: the same job posts
 * `<facade> / <label>` on the pull-request path and
 * `Release / <facade> / <label>` on the release path. A gate-level value would

 * The flag is deliberately *may*, and deliberately registry-only. A project can
 * point `format-conformance` at `format:check` (which rewrites nothing) or at
 * `format` (which rewrites everything), and Lisa cannot tell which from here.
 * Ordering a non-rewriter early costs nothing — order among independent gates

 *   for this gate**, not about the gate. `deps: false` says that prover runs

 *   and its own siblings. Absent means the prover needs the project's
 *   dependencies, which is the safe answer and therefore the default.
 *
 * `deps` is registry-only because it is only ever safe as a claim about a

 * Lisa's canonical gates.
 *
 * `label` is the CI job name and it is load-bearing: a repository ruleset names

 * is built from.
 *
 * `moments` is the closed set of places a gate may legally be declared. It
 * exists to make wrong configurations unrepresentable rather than merely
 * discouraged: type-aware lint at commit needs a whole-project build, and a
 * DAST scan at commit has nothing deployed to point at.
 *
 * `work` names what a nonzero count proves, for gates that can otherwise
 * succeed having done nothing.
 *
 * `task` is the default prover, and `taskAt` overrides it for one moment
 * family. Most gates need only `task`: `typecheck` is `typecheck` wherever it
 * runs. A gate needs `taskAt` when the same property is proved by a different
 * command at a different moment — the shape the design doc already calls
 * normal for a project's own `run` declarations, here as a shipped default so
 * that declaring the gate at that moment cannot silently resolve to a prover
 * that cannot run there.
 *
 * `task` names the CONCERN, never the vendor — `test:e2e`, not
 * `test:playwright`. That is deliberate and load-bearing: a project swapping
 * one tool for another must not have to edit this registry, and a gate label
 * built from it must not turn a tool swap into a branch-protection migration.
 * The cost is that the concern name is frequently NOT the name a template
 * ships, and until `declareOnly` existed nothing said so.
 *
 * Measured 2026-08-21, resolving each stack the way `PackageLisaStrategy` does
 * (parent template, then child), across all seven npm stacks: of 35 default
 * tasks **11 resolved on every stack, 1 resolved on a single stack, and 23
 * resolved on none**. Seven of those 23 have had a working prover the whole
 * time under a name of the vendor's: `test:cov`, `knip:check`, `sg:scan`,
 * `lighthouse:check`, `maestro:test`, `k6:load`, `security:zap`. Declaring any
 * of those gates fails as `Missing script` in the consumer's CI, with nothing
 * pointing at the prover sitting beside it.
 *
 * So the fix is NOT to rename the defaults to those vendor scripts — that
 * would buy one release of convenience by giving up the property above. It is
 * to make the gap first-class:
 *
 * - `declareOnly` is present exactly when `task` does not resolve on every npm
 *   stack, and says what to do about it.
 * - `shippedAs` names the script a template already ships for that concern,
 *   where one exists, so an operator can point `run:` straight at it.
 *
 * `shippedAs` is RESOLVED THROUGH, not merely documented — see `resolveMoment`.
 * Recording the alias and then never reading it (#2916) left the registry
 * knowing, in machine-readable form, that a working prover sat in the
 * consumer's own `package.json`, while every operator surface still resolved to
 * the concern name and failed as `Missing script`. The fallback fires only when
 * the concern-named script is genuinely absent and the alias is genuinely
 * present, so it can never widen what resolves: the concern name stays the
 * gate's identity, its label, and its first choice.
 *
 * The ABSENCE of `declareOnly` is therefore a claim, and
 * `tests/unit/config/gate-default-tasks-resolve.test.ts` enforces it in both
 * directions: a gate without the field must resolve on every npm stack, and a
 * gate with it must genuinely fail somewhere. The second half is what retires
 * an exception once its prover ships, instead of leaving a stale excuse.

/**
 * Every `quality.yml` job that resolves through the gate façade, and its gate.

 * This table and the two below exist so that the answer to "which gate replaces
 * this `skip_jobs` token" can be read in a CONSUMER. It could not be, before:
 * the pairs lived in one of Lisa's own test fixtures, which no consumer
 * installs, so `lisa doctor` running in a caller repository and an agent working
 * in a caller checkout both had nothing authoritative to consult.
 *
 * Eleven of the pairs cannot be recovered by transforming the name — `lint` is
 * `code-style`, `sg_scan` is `structural-rules`, `work_item_traceability` is
 * `traceability`. An underscore-to-hyphen guess gets a minority of them right,
 * and being wrong here does not break a build: it declares the WRONG gate
 * `off`, so a check silently stops running while the configuration reads
 * deliberate. That is why this ships as data rather than as advice.
 *
 * It is STATIC on purpose. A consumer holds no copy of `quality.yml` — it calls
 * the reusable workflow by ref — so the table cannot be derived where it is
 * read. `tests/integration/quality-gate-skip-jobs-mapping.test.ts` derives it
 * from the workflow in the one repository that has the workflow and fails when
 * the two disagree, which is what keeps a static copy true.

 * outside the hand-written set was unreachable from a declaration no matter
 * what a project wrote. That asymmetry is the root cause behind several filed
 * symptoms, and it closes by making the workflow ask the registry too.
 *
 * ## Which gates get a leg, and why `off` is included
 *
 * Every gate the project DECLARES at this moment, including the ones declared
 * `off`, minus the ones a hand-written job already posts a context for.
 *
 * Including `off` is the half that is easy to get wrong and expensive to get
 * wrong. A required context that never reports does not read as skipped — it
 * holds the pull request at "Expected — Waiting for status to be reported",
 * forever. `contextsFor` will not emit a context for an `off` gate, so the two
 * agree for a project whose ruleset is generated from the same declaration; a
 * ruleset that still names it must still see it report. So an `off` leg runs,
 * says out loud that the project turned this gate off, and succeeds.
 *
 * ## What a leg cannot do, and says instead
 *
 * A leg's body is `$runner $task`. Where nothing resolves to a task — a custom
 * `x-` gate the project declared without a `run:`, say — the leg reports
 * `unproved` and FAILS. That is deliberate and it is the distinction between
 * this and the defect it replaces: a job that skips its proving step when the
 * prover is missing reports green having measured nothing. Absent is not a
 * skip, and a leg that measured nothing must be loud rather than absent.
 *
 * `await`, `intercept`, and `builtin` gates get no leg at all, which is a
 * different statement: those are proved by a vendor, by Lisa internally, or
 * by the governing facade, and a leg would be a second reporter for one
 * property.

/**
 * Jobs that are NOT DECLARABLE, and why that is a rule rather than an omission.
 *
 * **A gate whose job is to detect silencing cannot itself be silenceable.**
 *
 * Every other job in `quality.yml` answers to the project's declaration: set
 * its gate `off` and it stands down, or name its token in `skip_jobs` and it
 * never starts. The jobs listed here judge that declaration, or judge whether
 * the merge rules it feeds are being satisfied by anything real. Giving them an
 * off-switch lets a project say "do not check whether I switched checks off",
 * which is not a weaker version of the same claim — it is the claim that makes
 * every other declaration unverifiable.
 *
 * So membership means three things at once, and the invariant is worth stating
 * as three because two of them were true of `skipped_required_checks` while the
 * third was not, and the missing one was the whole defect (#2933):
 *
 *  1. no `QUALITY_JOB_GATES` row — nothing to declare `off`;
 *  2. no entry in `SKIP_JOB_TOKENS`, and no `skip_jobs` token in the job's
 *     `if:` — nothing to name in a caller;
 *  3. no `UNGATED_QUALITY_JOBS` exemption — this table is the reason, and a
 *     second record of the same job in the "no gate yet" table would say the
 *     opposite: that a gate is still owed.
 *
 * `skipped_required_checks` was exempt from the registry as a meta-gate and
 * carried a skip token anyway, so the exemption bought it nothing: the
 * off-switch it was exempted from acquiring already existed one layer down.
 * #2846 read the missing row as an oversight and proposed a declarable gate.
 * The owner's ruling was to remove the token instead and match
 * `gate_config_validity`, which is exempt AND has no token, which is why
 * nothing can silence it.
 *
 * This is NOT a licence to make a gate unskippable because it is important.
 * The test is circularity, not severity: would the off-switch disable the
 * checking of off-switches? `test_unit` is far more important than either of
 * these and is fully declarable, because declaring it `off` removes its
 * required context too — one declaration drives both sides, and the result is

 * `lisa-gates.mjs unconfigured`, which is what the pre-push hook and every
 * gated CI job call to say what they just ran ungoverned.
 *
 * `command` is DESCRIPTIVE, not executable. It names what the artifact runs so
 * a report can print it; `<runner>` stands for the project's task runner,
 * `<package-manager>` for the caller's, `<lisa>` for wherever the installed
 * package resolved — all three are decided at run time.
 *

 * `test-correctness` defaults to `test:unit`. Seeding the default there would
 * silently stop enforcing coverage at push while the configuration read
 * deliberate. Where `seedRun` is a non-empty array it lists candidate task
 * names in preference order; where it is `null` the registry default already
 * matches; where it is an EMPTY array nothing a project could name reproduces
 * the built-in, so `seedGates` declares nothing for it.
 *
 * Kept true by `tests/integration/hardcoded-invocation-inventory.test.ts`,
 * which derives the population from the shipped artifacts in BOTH directions:

 * Which moments THIS repository actually runs gates at, read off its workflows.
 *
 * The registry's `no-runner-for-moment` verdict used to be an ASSERTION: every
 * declaration in a deploy or continuous family got told "nothing runs gates
 * here at all yet", because at the time nothing did. That sentence is a fact
 * about the repository, not about the gate, and hardcoding it has two failure
 * modes that arrive together. It keeps saying "nothing runs this" after a runner
 * ships — a control lying in the reassuring direction. And it keeps EXCUSING a
 * declaration that resolves to no prover, calling it inert-but-fine, at exactly
 * the moment the runner would have executed it and reported UNPROVABLE.
 *
 * So it is measured instead. A repository executes a moment when one of its
 * workflows names that moment to a gate runner.
 *
 * ## Family, when the environment is computed
 *
 * A deploy caller writes `moment: pre-deploy:${{ ... }}` — the family is
 * literal and the environment is a run-time expression. Requiring an exact
 * match would report "no runner" for every real deploy façade there is, so a
 * computed environment registers the FAMILY, and any moment in it counts as
 * executed. A value with no readable family (`moment: ${{ inputs.moment }}`,
 * which is how a reusable workflow forwards its own input) contributes nothing:
 * it is plumbing between two workflows, and the caller at the other end is the
 * one that made a statement about a moment.
 *
 * ## An unreadable directory answers "nothing", and that is the honest answer
 *
 * A repository with no `.github/workflows` runs no workflows, so no workflow of
 * its executes any moment. That is not a guess made under uncertainty; it is
 * the measurement.

 * The contexts Lisa's own registry proves NOTHING will post any more.
 *
 * A required status check that never reports does not fail a pull request —
 * GitHub holds it at "Expected — Waiting for status to be reported", forever.
 * There is no red tick and no log, so a ruleset naming a context Lisa retired
 * red-walls every pull request in that repository and nothing says why. The
 * only cheap way to find one is to compare what a ruleset requires against
 * what a job can still post, and this is the "can still post" half.
 *
 * `previousLabels` is the ONLY evidence that makes the claim provable rather
 * than inferred. A context absent from the derived set is not enough on its
 * own: a repository may legitimately require a status posted by a third-party
 * app or by a job its own CI defines, and a sweep that flagged every
 * externally-produced context would be noise an operator learns to ignore.
 * A `previousLabels` entry is different in kind — it is Lisa's record that
 * Lisa renamed its own job, so Lisa knows with certainty that no run will ever
 * post the old name again.
 *
 * A retired label some OTHER gate has since adopted as its current label is
 * dropped: that string is posted again, by a different job, so requiring it is
 * not a red-wall. The guard is why this reads the whole registry rather than
 * one entry's field.
 * Every entry carries the retired label and the replacement label BARE, next
 * to the `/`-joined contexts built from the default chain. A consumer holding a
 * live ruleset cannot assume that chain: a check run's reported name is the
 * `/`-joined chain of the JOB names reaching it, and the depth varies with
 * nesting — one level on the pull-request path, two on the release path, where
 * the same gate posts `Release / <quality workflow> / <label>`. Such a
 * consumer matches the retired label as the FINAL context segment and rebuilds
 * the replacement
 * against the chain it actually found, which is what `label` and
 * `replacementLabel` are for. `context` and `replacement` remain the
 * default-chain rendering, for a caller that has no live ruleset to match.
