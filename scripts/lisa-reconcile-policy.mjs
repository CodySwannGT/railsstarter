/**
 * @file Reconcile DECLARED gate/policy config against the LIVE GitHub ruleset.
 *
 * `lisa-gates.mjs` can already *derive* the branch-protection contexts a
 * repository ought to require: `contextsFor(gates, {moment: "pull-request"})`.
 * What it cannot do is say whether GitHub agrees. That answer lives in a
 * ruleset a human edits in an admin console, and until now the only way to hold
 * the two together was to transcribe the live list into
 * `.github/required-checks.json` by hand — a snapshot that ships empty, expires
 * after 90 days, and was measured wrong in BOTH directions (#2476: it claimed a
 * context was required that nothing required, and omitted six that were).
 *
 * This script replaces the transcription with a comparison. It reads the live
 * ruleset through `gh`, derives the declared list from `.lisa.config.json`, and
 * reports three sets: MISSING (declared, not live), EXTRA (live, not declared),
 * MATCHED. It reads repository settings the same way and compares them against
 * the `policy` block.
 *
 * ## Could-not-check is not clean
 *
 * There is a third verdict beside matched and drifted, and it is the one this
 * script exists to get right. If `gh` is absent, unauthenticated, refused (a
 * private repo on a plan without rulesets answers 403), or returns something
 * unparseable, the verdict is **UNPROVEN** — its own state, carrying its own
 * exit code (2), with the drift sets set to `null` rather than to empty arrays.
 * Empty arrays are what a clean repository looks like, so a failed read that
 * produced them would render as "policy matches" and be indistinguishable from
 * proof. The structure makes that unrepresentable: an unproven result has no
 * sets to read, and `on_drift` does not govern it, because `on_drift` answers
 * what to do about a drift you have MEASURED and here nothing was measured.
 *
 * ## An EXTRA context is never deleted without being named
 *
 * `repair` ADDS what is missing. It does not remove what is extra unless
 * `--prune` is passed, and even then it names every context it removes first.
 *
 * The reason is that Lisa does not own the whole required list. A repository
 * routinely requires contexts posted by external apps — `SonarCloud Code
 * Analysis`, `GitGuardian Security Checks`, `CodeRabbit` — which no gates block
 * declares and which `contextsFor` therefore cannot derive. Every one of those
 * is EXTRA by construction. A repair that treated EXTRA as "delete to converge"
 * would silently strip live protection on its first run, and the deletion would
 * read in the audit log as a routine reconciliation. So the default is: add,
 * report, and require a human to ask for the removal.
 *
 * That is also why an EXTRA context does not FAIL `on_drift: block`. It is
 * reported by name in every mode, and it still makes the verdict DRIFT — there
 * genuinely is a difference between the declaration and the repository. But
 * blocking on it would make `block` a mode no repository with a SonarCloud or
 * CodeRabbit check can ever satisfy, since by construction nothing declares
 * those and this script refuses to remove them. A check that cannot pass while
 * the repository is correct gets one fix from whoever is blocked by it —
 * `--prune`, or deleting the check — and both of those lose protection. So
 * `block` fails on the drift a repair could converge: MISSING contexts, and
 * settings drift. Under `--prune` an EXTRA becomes removable, and therefore
 * blocking, because the operator has said it should be.
 *
 * ## Only a workflow context is pinned to the Actions app
 *
 * A required check can name the app allowed to post it. Every context Lisa
 * derives from a `run` gate is posted by GitHub Actions, so it is pinned. An
 * `await` gate's context is posted by somebody else entirely — that is what
 * awaiting means — and pinning `CodeRabbit` to the Actions integration would
 * require a status that the only app able to post it can never satisfy. Those
 * are added unpinned, which is GitHub's "any source".
 *
 * ## The alias window
 *
 * `--previous=a,b` is passed through to `contextsFor`'s `previousLabels`, which
 * emits BOTH the old and the new context for one release. During a job rename
 * the old context stops reporting the moment the workflow changes, and a
 * required context that never reports blocks every in-flight pull request
 * indefinitely. The fastest way out of that for whoever is blocked is deleting
 * the requirement — which is how a rename quietly removes a guarantee. Requiring
 * both names for one release is what avoids it. Downstream repositories call
 * the shared workflow unpinned, so the rename reaches them before any of them
 * has reconciled; the window is not optional.
 *
 * ## One writer per surface
 *
 * Repair writes exactly two things: required-status-check contexts on a ruleset
 * (PUT), and repository settings (PATCH). Policy that lives in the SHAPE of a
 * ruleset's rules — linear history, signed commits, force-push and deletion
 * protection, conversation resolution — is compared and reported here but
 * repaired by `scripts/lisa-github-rulesets.sh`, which owns rule construction.
 * Reshaping rules from two places is how a repair strips a rule it did not
 * understand.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   lisa-reconcile-policy.mjs [--repo=OWNER/NAME] [--moment=pull-request]
 *                             [--workflow="🔍 Quality Checks"] [--previous=a,b]
 *                             [--on-drift=repair|report|block] [--ruleset=NAME]
 *                             [--dry-run] [--prune] [--json]
 *
 * Exit codes:
 *   0  matched, or drift under `repair`/`report`, or EXTRA-only drift under
 *      `block`
 *   1  convergeable drift under `block`, or a repair write that failed
 *   2  UNPROVEN — nothing was measured

/**
 * Compare declared contexts against live ones.
 *
 * Comparison is exact string equality, deliberately. A repository routinely
 * carries confusable pairs — an app's required `GitGuardian Security Checks`
 * beside a not-required `🔐 Credential Leakage` proving the same property,
 * `🧹 Lint` beside `🐢 Slow Lint Rules` — and a fuzzy match raises a false
 * alarm whose obvious fix is deleting the guard.
 * ## Why a name alone is not the comparison
 *
 * A context declared in `github.rulesets.requiredChecks` carries structure —
 * the ruleset that owns it, and often an `integration_id` pinning WHICH app may
 * satisfy it. Reducing the declaration to a bare name threw that away, so a
 * context declared pinned in one ruleset was reported as matched by an
 * UNPINNED context of the same name in a different ruleset. No repair was
 * produced, and the requirement stayed satisfiable by a writer the project
 * never named — which is the whole property the pin exists to establish.
 *
 * The constraint applies only where the project actually declared one.
 * A gate-derived context names no ruleset and no app, so it keeps matching on
 * name against any active ruleset; nothing is tightened that was never stated.
 * @param {object} options Comparison inputs.
 * @param {string[]} options.declared Contexts `contextsFor` derived.
 * @param {LiveContext[]} options.live Contexts read from the rulesets.
 * @param {Record<string, string>} [options.homes] Declared ruleset per context,
 *   from `declaredChecks`. A context absent here declares no owner.
 * @param {Record<string, number>} [options.pins] Declared app id per context,
 *   from `declaredChecks`. A context absent here declares no writer.
 * @param {Array<{context: string, ruleset?: string, integration_id?: number}>} [options.records]
 *   One record per declared (ruleset, context) pair, from `declaredChecks`.
 *   Supplied, it is what the comparison is made of; absent, the name-keyed
 *   `homes`/`pins` projection is reconstituted into equivalent records.
 * @param {Array<{context:string, ruleset?:string, integration_id?:number}>} [options.awaited]
 *   Awaited declarations, preserving their ruleset identity and declared pin.
 *   A declaration carrying a ruleset becomes a comparison record of its own,
 *   unless `records` already declares that same (ruleset, context) pair.
