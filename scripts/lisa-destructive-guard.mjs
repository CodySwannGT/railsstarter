 * lisa-destructive-guard — the executable arm of `production-fails-closed`.
 *
 * The `reset-seed-coverage` contract already says the right thing: production
 * is refused "with no override, escape hatch, or environment variable that
 * changes the answer", `--dry-run` is mandatory before anything destructive,
 * and a caller-supplied `--stage` is a *request* to be checked against
 * server-resolved identity rather than the source of truth. Until this module
 * existed, all three were prose — an agent reading a rule and choosing to stop.
 * Measured conformance for that rung in this codebase was approximately zero,
 * including by the agent that authored the rule. For a destructive,
 * irreversible operation that is the wrong rung, so the decision moves here.
 *
 * Three properties make this a control rather than a suggestion:
 *
 * 1. **No override exists to be found.** There is no `force` parameter, no
 *    `allowProduction` field, and no environment-variable read anywhere in this
 *    file — a test greps the shipped source for the latter, so the claim cannot
 *    rot. A caller cannot pass the wrong thing because there is no right thing
 *    to pass. The tests assert the absence structurally, not behaviourally.
 * 2. **Ambiguity resolves to refusal.** An environment identity that cannot be
 *    read is treated exactly like production. "I could not tell" must never be
 *    the cheaper answer than "it is production".
 * 3. **A dry run is not a pass.** `dryRun: true` does not soften a production
 *    denial. Enumerating production state is still reaching into production,
 *    and allowing it would hand every caller a one-flag override.
 *
 * What this module deliberately does NOT claim: it cannot verify that the
 * `environment` an adapter reports is the environment it actually connected to.
 * An adapter that resolves its stage from a caller-supplied string and reports
 * `"dev"` while pointed at production defeats every in-process check by
 * construction. That hole is why the contract says platform enforcement beats
 * process enforcement, and why the durable answer is a capability that is not
 * deployed to production at all — see `docs/decisions/`. This module closes the
 * narrower hole Lisa can close: an honest adapter can no longer report a
 * successful destructive production run, in any repo, by any path.
 * @module scripts/lisa-destructive-guard
