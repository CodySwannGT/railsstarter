/**
 * File families the ratchet watches. `kind` selects the extractor;
 * `direction` applies to numeric-leaf kinds ("min" values may only rise,
 * "max" values may only fall).
 *
 * PER-FAMILY POLICY, reviewed 2026-08-12. A family keeps its ratchet unless a
 * NAMED deterministic non-regression invariant replaces the property the
 * ratchet was providing — deleting a ratchet deletes that property with it, so
 * "this generates churn" is a reason to find a replacement, never a reason to
 * delete on its own:
 *
 *   coverage / simplecov / e2e   KEPT. Here the ratchet IS the non-regression
 *     invariant, and no per-item equivalent exists short of committing a
 *     per-file coverage baseline — an artifact that only ever accumulates.
 *     Revisit if one appears.
 *   stryker                      KEPT. `thresholds.break` is an absolute floor,
 *     kept outright; the mutate-list comparison detects EXEMPTION ADDITIONS
 *     rather than creep, and has no number for a pull request to nudge.
 *   eslint / rubocop / k6 / lisa-config   KEPT, unchanged.
 *
 * Exactly one family was replaced, and it is not watched here and never was:
 * the BDD traceability floor, whose numeric ratchet gave way to per-obligation
 * checks. See `expo/copy-overwrite/scripts/bdd/baseline.mjs`.
 *
 * Retiring a family is SEQUENCED: the replacement invariant lands, then a
 * `thresholdRatchet.allow` entry merges from the base side, then the mechanism
 * changes. Never the reverse — this checker is precisely what stops a change
 * granting itself the exception that permits it.

 * for a weakening to pass the ratchet, and it had no expiry, no review and no
 * removal path — nothing read the `reason`, so an exemption granted for a
 * temporary condition (a migration in flight, a suite being rewritten, a
 * dependency waiting upstream) outlived the condition and kept applying,
 * silently, forever. The set of gates actually enforced therefore shrank
 * monotonically while every individual decision that shrank it was correct at
 * the time. A control whose exception list only grows converges on no control.
 *
 * The shape is taken from `_thresholdsDivergence` in `stryker.conf.json`,
 * governed by `src/sync/stryker-thresholds-ownership.ts` — the one exemption
 * surface in this repository that already stops exempting when it goes stale.
 * Its three properties are reproduced here: the entry records its condition in
 * a form something can evaluate, the reason says what resolves it, and once the
 * condition passes the entry stops exempting AND says so, naming the remedy.
 *
 * `unchecked` is deliberately NOT `expired`. An entry written before `until`
 * existed names a condition nothing can evaluate, which is the prose situation
 * the ticket describes — it is reported every run, loudly, and it keeps
 * exempting. Refusing it instead would red-wall every project mid-migration
