 * Contract version of the traceability gate's script half, reported by the

 * The two halves travel by different routes — `quality.yml` / `quality-rails.yml`
 * by git ref at `@main`, this file by `lisa apply` — so they WILL drift, exactly
 * as the nightly-e2e gate's header says of its own pair. The registry says so
 * too: `scripts/two-channel-couplings.json` carries this coupling twice.
 *
 * Before this constant existed the workflow's only staleness signal was probing
 * for the `verify-level` subcommand, which is a single hardcoded floor at #2721.
 * Below that floor staleness was visible; above it a copy was indistinguishable
 * from current no matter how old — a copy from 2026-08-18, a major behind,
 * satisfied the probe in silence (#3477). A version is what makes "how old"
 * answerable at all; enforcement was downstream of a number that did not exist.
 *
 * MAJOR — the workflow half cannot drive this script correctly any more: a
 * subcommand it invokes is gone or renamed, an exit code changed meaning, or an
 * env var the workflow sets is no longer read. A mismatch FAILS the gate closed.
 * MINOR — the contract still holds but the logic behind it moved: a new
 * requirement, a fixed parse, a changed message. Reported, never fatal.
 * PATCH — nothing a caller can observe.
 *
 * Bump the MINOR whenever a change to this file would alter a verdict the gate
 * reports, so a consumer running old logic can be told how far behind it is.

 * ## Lane attribution: which agent lane produced this, without saying who
 *
 * Every session in this fleet — and the human operator — pushes under ONE git
 * identity, so `author.login` is a constant across every commit, branch and
 * pull request. That is correct for accountability (the human IS the author of
 * all of it) and useless for ROUTING: a green pull request nobody armed, a
 * branch carrying finished work, an unpushed body found in a worktree sweep —
 * none of them can be handed back to whoever should finish them, because the
 * record does not say which lane made them. A survey has to guess from branch
 * names and file mtimes, and guesses have been wrong in both directions.
 *
 * The obvious remedy — record the session URL — is itself a defect: this is a
 * public repository and a published session identifier is an
 * identifier-hygiene problem, filed separately. So the requirement is narrower
 * than "add provenance":
 *
 * - it must distinguish WHICH lane to route to;
 * - it must publish nothing that is itself an identifier;
 * - it must survive the branch being deleted, which is when routing matters
 *   most, because pull requests auto-delete their branch on merge;
 * - and it must not imply the human is not the accountable author.
 *
 * A lane id satisfies all four. It is `lane-` followed by twelve hex
 * characters of a SHA-256 over an owner id the AGENT RUNTIME supplied — never
 * the id itself. The digest is one-way over a high-entropy input, so it names
 * no session, no URL, no person and no project; it is a stable handle that
 * only a live lane can claim, by deriving its own and finding them equal.
 *
 * ### Written once, at the source
 *
 * The stamp goes on at `prepare-commit-msg`, in the process that is making the
 * commit, from that process's own environment. An attribution reconstructed
 * later — from a branch name, a timestamp, a report of a report — loses
 * fidelity at every hop, and the sweep that motivated this is exactly that
 * failure. `--if-exists=doNothing` means a rebase, an amend or a cherry-pick
 * by a DIFFERENT lane preserves the original stamp rather than stealing the
 * attribution.
 *
 * ### One primitive, three surfaces
 *
 * `renderLaneTrailer` / `parseLaneId` are deliberately text-in, text-out and
 * carry no assumption that the text is a commit message. The same pair serves
 * a commit trailer, a pull-request body marker and a tracker comment footer —
 * the three places sibling work needs lane attribution — so the fleet has one
 * token vocabulary rather than three bespoke ones.

 * closed issues carried an active lifecycle role, six of them carrying the ready
 * role and the terminal role at once. That pair is not cosmetic — the build

 * The two contracts this gate can be asked to prove.
 *
 * `trailer` — the DEFAULT — proves that the change names a work item: a
 * `Work-Item:` line exists, is well formed, names the configured tracker's
 * repository or project, matches this worktree's binding, and is the same
 * reference on the commits and on the pull-request body. Every one of those is
 * decidable from the text and the local config, so it needs no credential of
 * any kind.
 *
 * `full` adds the requirements that need tracker API access, two of them read
 * and one of them WRITE: the item exists, is open, carries a `repo:` label
 * naming this repository, is a leaf, and carries a verified backlink to this
 * pull request.
 *
 * `full` is not a promise that any of the read checks RAN. When the tracker
 * cannot be asked — no credential, no binary, an outage — they are reported as
 * skipped and the commit proceeds on the offline checks alone. An absent
 * credential is not a verdict about a work item, and treating it as one refuses
 * finished work on every surface that has no key. The pull-request check is
 * where a credential is genuinely required, and it does not degrade.
 *
 * Claim state is deliberately NOT in that list; see the note where
 * `assertClaimedLifecycle` used to be.
 *
 * The default flipped in #2721. `full` was the only contract on offer, so a
 * project unwilling to hand a tracker API key to CI could not satisfy the gate
 * in any form — the traceability requirement and the tracker-integration
 * requirement were one thing, and only the first is what the gate is for.
 *
 * Declared rather than inferred from whichever credentials happen to be
 * present. Inferring it would make the gate's strength a property of the
 * environment: delete a secret and the check quietly asks for less, with the
 * decision recorded nowhere. A level in the config says what the project
 * decided, and `verify-level` prints what actually resolved.

 * The second ground truth `validate-commit` needs. `assertStateMatches` has
 * exactly one notion of what a worktree is working on — the `lisa-track`
 * binding — and when that file is absent it compares the trailer against
 * nothing and accepts any well-formed reference for the configured project.
 * Measured 2026-08-20 on one machine: 3 of 47 linked worktrees carried a
 * binding and the primary checkout carried none, so the comparison was a no-op
 * in ~94% of working copies while the hook printed `WORK_ITEM_TRACKING_OK`
 * either way. What it let through is permanent: a pull-request body is two
 * clicks to correct, a pushed commit message is history. The guarded surface
 * was the loud one.
 *
 * The branch name is already in hand, which is the property that matters for
 * something that runs on every single commit — no tracker call, no I/O beyond
 * the `git` invocation the binding path already makes.
 *
 * Only the CONFIGURED project or team key is matched. A branch naming some
 * other key (`feat/ABC-9-…`) yields undefined and the caller accepts, rather
 * than `canonicalizeRef` refusing it as out-of-project: this is a fallback for
 * a comparison that was silently not happening, and a fallback that invents
 * refusals nobody had before is a worse trade than the gap it closes.
 *
 * Case-insensitive, and that is load-bearing rather than defensive. Agent
 * branch names are routinely lower case (`claude/se-7220-…`), so the
 * upper-case-only `[A-Z]{2,10}-[0-9]+` shape that Jira-key tooling reaches for
 * by habit would match nothing at all here. Reusing it would parse nothing,
 * take the fail-open path on every commit, and print the same success line: a
 * second fail-open wearing the first fix's clothes, and strictly worse than
 * the gap, because the gap would now be believed closed.
 * EXPORTED, AND TAKING THE BRANCH AS AN ARGUMENT, so the provider dispatch is
 * reachable in process. `githubBranchIssue` below was split out for that
 * reason and is measurable; the routing that decides whether it is called at
 * all was not. The CLI cases exercise these lines only by SPAWNING the script,
 * and a spawned child loads the file from disk rather than the instrumented
 * module, so a mutant here is activated in a process the assertions never
 * observe. It survives, and the gate reports a score rather than reporting
 * that it measured nothing — `if (false)` on the provider arm routes every
 * GitHub branch away from the extractor and restores the defect
 * CodySwannGT/lisa#3861 closed, while every end-to-end case still passes.
 * Measured after the split, over these lines only: 21 mutants, 19 killed,
 * 90.48%, where before the split every mutant here was unkillable. The one
 * survivor left inside this function is `if (!branch)` mutated to `if (false)`,
 * and it is EQUIVALENT rather than unproven: both arms already decline an
 * absent name on their own — the GitHub reading needs a slash-segment starting
 * with a digit, the key-based reading needs the configured key — so no input
 * distinguishes the two programs. The guard stays because it is the documented
 * fail-open and because the next arm added here may not be so forgiving; the
 * equivalence is recorded so a later reader does not mistake it for a gap.
 * @param {string|undefined} branch Active branch name, if any.

 * be wrong; declining them fails open, which is the safe direction.
 *
 * EXPORTED SO IT CAN BE TESTED IN PROCESS, and that is not a formality. The

 * the mutation gate cannot see through it: measured, 12 of 12 mutants in this

 * scored 85.71% off the in-process importers. Taking `branch` as an argument

 *
 * This said FOUR until #2681 counted them properly. Gates 3 and 4 shared a
 * line — "every commit AND the pull-request body carry ONE matching trailer" —
 * which reads as one requirement and is two: the commit-msg hook enforces the
 * message, and a separate check enforces the BODY. An operator whose commits
 * carried the trailer read that line as cleared. Measured: an agent went
 * BLOCKED on "No Work-Item trailer anywhere in the pull request body" holding a
 * commit that carried the trailer, an item in the claimed role, and a backlink
 * already posted — four of the five satisfied, and the fifth invisible until CI
 * said so, one cycle later. (That measurement predates the claim gate's removal
 * and is left as it was recorded; the counting defect it describes is about
 * gates 3 and 4, which are both still enforced.)
 *
 * `Closes owner/repo#N` is called out by name because it is the substitution a
 * reader reaches for: it closes the item on merge and satisfies nothing here.
 *
 * Listing all five in the report an operator actually reads costs six lines and
 * turns a sequence of surprises into one checklist. The role NAMES come from
 * the resolved contract rather than from Lisa's own defaults, because a project
 * configures its own — lifecycle is a workflow STATE on Jira and Linear and a
 * LABEL only on GitHub — and a summary that confidently names the wrong label
 * is worse than none.

 * True when this range introduced no authored work of its own, and at least one

 *
 * ## Why the condition is stated against `examined`
 *
 * The deferral used to read `relevant === 0 && mergeExempt > 0`. Both halves
 * are true of every range that should defer, but only one of them SAYS so.
 * `mergeExempt > 0` is satisfied by a range in which SOME commits are merges —
 * strictly weaker than the precondition the deferral means to assert, which is
 * that not one commit in the range authored anything. It coincided with the
 * right answer because `relevant === 0` was carrying that claim, so the two
 * agreed by accident rather than by construction, and a refactor that loosened
 * `relevant` would have taken the deferral with it silently
 * (CodySwannGT/lisa#3921).
 *
 * Stating it as "every commit examined was exempt" makes the predicate
 * self-sufficient: it reads the denominator directly instead of trusting a
 * counter that is incremented before the trailer is parsed.
 *
 * ## Why it is not `mergeExempt === examined`
 *
 * Because that is a DIFFERENT claim — "the range is nothing but merges" — and
 * it is strictly stronger than the one the deferral needs. A back-merge of a
 * non-default deploy branch legitimately drags release commits along with the
 * merge; those are exempt for their own reason, and a range of one merge plus
 * one `chore(release):` commit still introduced no authored work. Requiring
 * merges-only would refuse it with "no non-merge commit linked to a work item",
 * which is the #3851 deadlock returning through the door this closed.
 *
 * `mergeExempt > 0` stays as the second conjunct, and it is not the weak test
 * this replaced: it is what separates a deferral ("the subject is one level up,
 * at the merge's own pull request") from the release-only and deploy-chain
 * exemptions, which have their own branches and their own wording above.
 *
 * Exported so the predicate can be asserted directly. The push path reaches it
 * only through a spawned child, where the interesting case — a range whose
 * exemptions do not add up — cannot be built out of real commits at all.
 * @param {object} [result] Commit-side result from `validateCommits`.

 * Check every pull-request requirement and report all of the unmet ones.
 *
 * `rangeIsPartial` identifies the push range. Earlier PR commits may carry
 * declarations absent here, and a merge-only range has no authored work to check.
 *
 * The push path evaluates the UNPUSHED range — deliberately, and for a reason
 * that must not be undone: `parsePushGroups` excludes commits already on the
 * remote branch (validated by earlier pushes) and commits reachable from the
 * remote default branch, and it must never use `--remotes=<remote>`, whose ref
 * set includes the branch being force-pushed and would let a pusher exempt
 * arbitrary commits. That range is right. What was wrong is the verdict drawn
 * from it: this function's message says "Pull request has no non-merge commit
 * linked", which is a claim about the PULL REQUEST, made from a range that is
 * only a SUBSET of it.
 *
 * A merge-conflict resolution is the case that exposed it (#3851). Its unpushed
 * range is one merge commit; merges are trailer-exempt; the non-merge set is
 * therefore empty — while the pull request itself contains a perfectly
 * trailered non-merge commit that was validated on an earlier push. The gate
 * refused correctly-attributed work, and its advice ("amend the commit and
 * force-push") named a commit that does not exist and an operation the
 * destructive-command guard refuses. That deadlocked against
 * `artifact-freshness`, which requires the regeneration to live IN the merge.
 *
 * So when the range is partial and has nothing to check, the commit-side
 * question is DEFERRED rather than answered: it has no subject here, and its
 * subject is the pull request, where `validate-pr` asks it correctly from
 * `base..head` — a required, merge-blocking check (`🔗 Work-Item
 * Traceability`), so this defers to something that genuinely runs rather than
 * to nothing.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT an early return, for the same reason the `tracedWhereAuthored`
 * exemption below is not one: gates 4 and 5 are properties of the pull request
 * BODY and the tracker, met by a separate edit, and they stay enforced here
 * exactly as everywhere else. Returning would retire two working gates on
 * precisely the pull requests this makes pushable.

 * Why a push with nothing of its own to trace still passed.
 *
 * The symmetric clause to {@link alreadyTraced}, and the reason it exists is
 * the same defect one state along. A back-merge push whose range holds only
 * merge commits takes the deferral added for CodySwannGT/lisa#3851 and prints:
 *
 * ```
 * WORK_ITEM_TRACKING_OK 0 commit(s), PR body, and tracker backlink
 * ```
 *
 * A push whose range was simply EMPTY prints the same bytes. Both are true;
 * they are not the same fact. One says "the subject is one level up, at the
 * pull request whose range carries it", the other says "there was nothing to
 * look at". A reader cannot tell them apart, and the only thing that separates
 * them — the range — is not in the output (CodySwannGT/lisa#3886). Attribution
 * required measuring the range by hand and reading the source, neither of which
 * an operator reading a push transcript has.
 *
 * `alreadyTraced` renders nothing here: it fires only for `protectedExempt`,
 * and a back-merge onto a feature branch has none. So the zero went unexplained.
 *
 * ## The condition is the deferral's own, not a second opinion
 *
 * Both read {@link mergeOnlyRange}, deliberately: a message rendered on a
 * condition that merely AGREES with the deferral is a second implementation of
 * the same rule, free to drift from it, and a clause claiming a deferral that
 * did not happen is worse than no clause. This renders only on the push path,
 * where the range is ALWAYS a subset of the pull request's — `reportPushGroup`
 * passes `rangeIsPartial: true` unconditionally, and says why. `validate-pr`
 * reads the full `base..head` range and does not defer, which is why its
 * success line does not carry this.
 *
 * ## What it must say, and why the count alone did not
 *
 * A gate that stands down has to name what it stood down FROM and what still
 * ran, or the next reader cannot separate "deferred, correctly, with gates 4
 * and 5 still enforced" from "skipped" — and that distinction is the entire
 * subject of the surrounding work (CodySwannGT/lisa#3921). So the clause names
 * the count, names gate 3 as the one with no subject here, names where it is
 * asked instead, and names the gates that were enforced anyway.
 *
 * ## This adds sentences and relaxes nothing
 *
 * The verdict, the exit status and every gate are untouched: a clause is
 * appended to a line that already said OK. A diagnostic fix that also softened
 * enforcement would not be a diagnostic fix.
 * @param {object} result Commit-side result.

 * in `textContainsBacklink`, `===` on both native link fields — and the
 * completion path already canonicalises through `mergedPullRequestEvidence`.
 * A backlink WRITTEN from the raw string therefore did not match the same pull
 * request READ back a moment later if the two spellings differed by a trailing
 * slash, and the failure surfaces as "no verified backlink" on work that is
 * genuinely linked. Canonicalising here puts one spelling on both sides. It

 * where it is supplied, rather than written into the managed comment and
 * discovered later by the check it was supposed to satisfy.

 * spellings of one pull request conflict just as two different pull requests
 * do. The looser rule would have to canonicalise first and then accept, and
 * accepting evidence the caller spelled two ways is the direction that reports
 * unproven work as proven.
 *
 * An empty `LISA_PR_URL` is absent, unlike an empty `--pr-url`: exporting an

/**
 * Every work item a commit body DECLARES, by full-body scan.
 *
 * A declaration is the commit's own `Work-Item:` line. It is written by the
 * author of the work, enforced on every non-merge commit by the commit-msg
 * gate, and says "this commit is that item". A cross-reference says only that
 * somebody's pull request NAMED the item somewhere, which is a different and
 * much weaker claim — see `sweepDeclarations` for what that difference cost.
 *
 * Read through `workItemLines` — the whole body, prefix anchored at column zero
 * — rather than git's `%(trailers:key=Work-Item)`, and that is the load-bearing
 * part. Git's trailer parser only considers the LAST paragraph of a message,
 * and this project's commits put `Work-Item:` above the trailing co-author
 * block, so the parser does not see it as a trailer at all. Measured on
 * `origin/main`: the parser finds 602 distinct issues where a full-body scan
 * finds 835 — it misses 233, and the undercount is clean, plausible and
 * well-formed, which is why it survived. Anything in this fleet that counts or
 * verifies trailers has to scan the body (CodySwannGT/lisa#3859).
 *
 * It USED to carry its own regex, which is how the two readers drifted: that
 * one allowed leading whitespace where `workItemLines` anchors at column zero,
 * so it would have matched the context line of a verbose commit's own diff.
 * Measured over full `origin/main` history: 2,059 `Work-Item:` lines at column
 * zero and ZERO indented ones, so the looser form served no real input and
 * admitted one class of false positive. One definition now, not two (#3747).
 *
 * The `owner/name#number` filter stays HERE rather than moving down into the
 * reader. This function answers a narrower question — which issues in THIS
 * repository does the commit declare? — and a value the filter drops is one the
 * reader still saw. That ordering is what keeps a malformed trailer refusable
 * by the gate instead of invisible to it.
 * Qualified `github/owner/name#number` values use the SAME canonical resolver
 * as the gates, so the audit does not lose attribution accepted by a hook.
 * This audit still requires a hash-number declaration; supported issue URLs
 * remain a gate input, not a newly admitted audit declaration.
 *
 * CRLF needs nothing here, and a relayed review finding that said otherwise
 * was refuted rather than acted on. `workItemLines` splits on `/\r?\n/`, so a
 * CRLF line arrives without its carriage return; the value is trimmed besides.
 * The case is pinned in `work-item-cli-writes.test.ts` so the refutation is a
 * control rather than a paragraph.

 * request made every sibling in its batch look shipped, and a single pull
 * request was counted as evidence for several unrelated items at once.
 * Measured before this change: of 53 items the sweep reported as drifted, 8
 * had no commit on `main` declaring them at all — 15%, and every one of the 8
 * had a live worktree branch open against it. Applying the sweep would have
 * closed eight in-flight work items, and by this file's own words the closure
 * "would be indistinguishable from a real one afterwards".
 *
 * Reachability is also what confirms the work actually landed, rather than
 * trusting a pull request's `baseRefName` to say where it went.
 *
 * UNRESOLVABLE branches are reported, never silently dropped. A configured
 * deploy branch that resolves to no commit is a branch the sweep did not look
 * at, and a `continue` past it turns part of an absence claim into evidence
 * never read — the same shape as the truncated log below, which this function
 * already refuses over. It is not fatal on its own, because a project may
 * configure `dev` or `staging` in a clone that has only ever fetched `main`
 * and the sweep is still useful there; what it may not do is let the omission
 * go unsaid. When NOTHING resolved there is no evidence at all, and the run
 * refuses rather than reporting a clean queue.

/**
 * The two unchecked gates as open work, addressed to whoever runs the push.
 *
 * The wording is the whole point of this function, so it is worth saying what
 * it is deliberately NOT: `WORK_ITEM_TRACKING_OK`. This same text used to be
 * appended to that token, which made a finding arrive inside a success — and a
 * finding inside a success is not a finding. Nobody reads an unmet requirement
 * out of a line that opens by declaring the check passed, so the gate did the
 * hard part (it knows exactly which two requirements it could not reach, and
 * says so) and then threw the answer away in its own headline
 * (CodySwannGT/lisa#3791).
 *
 * The exit code stays 0, and that is not the same compromise. A push is the
 * only way to make a branch exist on the remote, and a pull request cannot be
 * opened for a branch the remote has never seen — so refusing here would be a
 * refusal with no remedy, and the first push of every branch would be
 * impossible. What is available at this moment is the OTHER half of a control:
 * name the unmet requirements as unmet, and name the command that discharges
 * them the moment they become checkable. `discharge-pr-gates` is that command,
 * and it is what makes this list closeable rather than merely honest.
 *
 * Gate 5 is stated as inapplicable rather than unresolved under the `trailer`
 * level, because a run that contacted no tracker has not left a backlink
 * unposted — it is not required at all there. Listing it as open work would
 * ask an operator to resolve something no check will ever look at.
 * Exported so the report can be asserted in-process. The push path reaches it
 * only through a spawned child, where a mutation run records no coverage and
 * scores every line of this text as unreached — so the subprocess cases prove
 * the WIRING and the direct cases prove the WORDS.
 * @param {object} result Commit-side result.
 * @param {string} label Prefix naming the ref, empty for a single-ref push.
 * @param {string} [scope] The range or tree this verdict was computed over.
