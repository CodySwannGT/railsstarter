/**
 * Reconcile the worktree a session was TOLD it is in against the one it is
 * ACTUALLY operating in, and refuse to act while the two disagree.
 *
 * WHAT WENT WRONG. `EnterWorktree` reported "the session is now working in the
 * worktree" for a tree that Bash never moved to and that Edit then refused by
 * name (CodySwannGT/lisa#3864). Three subsystems, three answers, and the one
 * that answered affirmatively was the wrong one. A refusal teaches you
 * something; a success message that is not true is a confirmation — it removes
 * the reason to check and sends the agent forward confidently in the wrong
 * place. Acting on that confirmation, one session ran an install that landed in
 * a different agent's active worktree. The next such command is a `git commit`
 * or a file write, and that tree held eighteen modified tracked files.
 *
 * The displacement is also mutual: whoever calls `EnterWorktree` last wins for
 * every session whose own binding never took, so each agent repairing itself
 * displaces the others. That is why "just re-enter your worktree" is not a
 * remedy — it is the mechanism.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FIXES AND WHAT IT CANNOT. Lisa does not own `EnterWorktree`, so it
 * cannot make that call itself return failure. What it can do is make the
 * false confirmation cost nothing: the FIRST action taken on the strength of it
 * is refused, and the refusal names the worktree the session is really bound
 * to. The gap is stated rather than hidden — the acceptance criterion asking
 * `EnterWorktree` to fail is met one tool call later, by the guard, not by the
 * tool.
 *
 * WHY BLOCKING AND NOT A WARNING. The failure mode is that nothing feels wrong.
 * There is no symptom to notice, so an advisory line scrolls past exactly when
 * it matters. A refusal is the only form of this check the agent cannot read
 * past.
 *
 * WHY AN EXPLICIT ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND NOT "BLOCK ONCE". A guard that blocks the
 * first attempt and lets the retry through is defeated by a blind retry, which
 * is the single most likely next action. So the block stands until the session
 * states, in the acknowledgement, the absolute path it now intends to work in.
 * A path that does not match what the session is actually in is refused too —
 * that is the rejection control, and it is what stops a stale acknowledgement
 * copied from another agent's transcript from silently rebinding this one.
 *
 * FAILING OPEN, LOUDLY. Anything this cannot determine — no session id, no
 * cwd, not a git repository, an unreadable state file — exits 0 with a line on
 * stderr. A guard that cannot read its input cannot tell a displacement from a
 * directory listing, and one that wedges every tool call is switched off within
 * the hour. Silence is the only outcome that is never acceptable.

/**
 * The foreign worktree an executed script reaches, or null.
 *
 * ## Why this arm exists at all
 *
 * The check above compares `payload.cwd` against the bound root, and that is
 * the right comparison — but **`payload.cwd` is sampled before the child
 * process runs**. A script that changes directory internally moves AFTER the
 * guard has measured. The guard is not wrong about the target; it is right
 * about a target that stops being the target one instruction later.
 *
 * A measurement taken before execution cannot bind what execution does
 * (CodySwannGT/lisa#3924). So the only thing left is to read what is about to
 * run.
 *
 * ## What this arm does NOT cover, stated rather than implied
 *
 * An INLINE redirect — `cd B && git status`, `git -C B status` — is not
 * refused here. Those are already refused by the runtime's own worktree
 * isolation, and duplicating a control is how two controls drift into
 * disagreeing. The scripted form is the one neither covers, and it is the only
 * cell this arm fills.
 *
 * That reason is a dependency on a runtime Lisa does not ship, and it can
 * expire without anything here failing. It is pinned at
 * {@link VERIFIED_RUNTIME_VERSION} and reported when the runtime moves off it
 * — read that constant before widening this arm.
 *
 * ## A relative script path is resolved against the cwd the command will have
 *
 * A leading `cd` establishes the directory this guard resolves relative tokens
 * from, because that is the directory the shell will be in once the command
 * runs. Resolving against `payload.cwd` instead was CodySwannGT/lisa#3933's
 * defect, inherited here knowingly and fixed in CodySwannGT/lisa#3952: on a
 * machine running many worktrees of one repository, every tree holds its own
 * copy of every script at the same relative path, and they differ by whatever
 * each lane is doing.
 *
 * ## One contract, two implementations, and why that is the honest answer
 *
 * `parity-safety-net.sh` answers this same question — "which file will this
 * command actually execute?" — in POSIX shell, where `follow_cd` mutates
 * file-scope state that `follow_locate` reads. This guard is Node. **There is
 * no call that reaches from here into a shell function's file-scope state**, so
 * the duplication is not a factoring somebody skipped; it is one idea that
 * cannot cross a language boundary as a function call.
 *
 * What binds the two is a written contract and a corpus of rows that BOTH
 * guards are driven over in CI, so a divergence fails a test on the commit that
 * causes it rather than surfacing later as a wrong verdict. Contract and corpus
 * live in `tests/unit/hooks/support/cwd-resolution-corpus.json`.
 *
 * This is explicitly NOT unification, and CodySwannGT/lisa#3952 records it as
 * such: two implementations remain. **A behaviour with no row in the corpus is
 * free to diverge — add a row when you add a branch.**
 *
 * ## The two guards agree on the RESOLUTION, not on the verdict
 *
 * When the effective directory cannot be known, both guards decline to resolve
 * the token. What they then do differs, and that difference is deliberate:
 * `parity-safety-net.sh` refuses, because a destructive command it cannot see
 * is the thing it exists to stop. This guard fails open, which is the doctrine
 * every other undecidable case in this file follows. The corpus asserts the
 * resolved path, not the exit code, precisely so that one contract can bind two
 * guards whose fail directions are correctly different.
 *
 * Fails OPEN and says so, like every other undecidable case in this file.

 * first use is assigned by the harness, unasked (CodySwannGT/lisa#3864), so the
 * one moment the guard trusted was the moment the session had least control
 * over. A session already sitting in a foreign worktree when it first acted
 * bound to that tree and was never refused, and every later call was then
 * checked faithfully against the wrong baseline — defending the session INTO
 * the wrong worktree rather than out of it (CodySwannGT/lisa#3955).
 *
 * ## Why an earlier observation separates what a cleverer check cannot
 *
 * At the first guarded call, "I was displaced before I acted" and "I
 * legitimately started here" present identically: one session id, one observed
 * root, no prior state. No comparison can tell them apart, because the
 * information is not in the hook's inputs at that instant.
 *
 * At session start it is. The displacement mechanism actually observed is a
 * PEER's `EnterWorktree` moving this session (CodySwannGT/lisa#3712), which
 * happens during the session — after it has started. A baseline taken at start
 * is therefore recorded BEFORE the event that moves it, and the first guarded
 * call becomes an ordinary comparison against a baseline that already exists.
 * It reaches the same refusal a later displacement produces, because by then it
 * is one.
 *
 * ## What this does NOT achieve
 *
 * #3955 asks for a baseline from the ASSIGNER rather than from observation.
 * That is not what this is and Lisa cannot build it: Lisa does not own
 * `EnterWorktree`, and nothing the harness writes names a session's assigned
 * worktree in a form a hook can read. This is still an observation, just an
 * earlier one. It closes the window between session start and the first guarded
 * call; it leaves open a session LAUNCHED already displaced, where start
 * observes the foreign tree and trust-on-first-use still applies.
 *
 * Returns nothing on purpose, like its sibling below: SessionStart has no call
 * to refuse, so every path through it allows.
 * @param bindingKeyValue - The key this baseline belongs to
 * @param observed - The worktree root the session started in

/**
 * The runtime version the inline-redirect gap was last verified at.
 *
 * ## What this constant is a pin ON
 *
 * This guard deliberately does NOT refuse an INLINE redirect into another
 * worktree — `cd <other> && git …`, `git -C <other> …`. The reason is good and
 * is written out at {@link scriptReachingForeignTree}: the runtime's own
 * worktree isolation already refuses them, and duplicating a control is how two
 * controls drift into disagreeing about the same command.
 *
 * That reason is a DEPENDENCY on behaviour Lisa does not ship. It was verified
 * refusing at this version, with the refusal wording "this command names git in
 * a form too complex to verify that it stays inside the worktree" and
 * "redirects git to the shared checkout via -C".
 *
 * ## Why a pin rather than a test
 *
 * The runtime's isolation is not reachable from a unit test: it adjudicates
 * inside a live worktree-isolated session, and there is no entry point that
 * takes one hook envelope and returns a verdict the way this guard does. So the
 * dependency cannot be turned red by writing a test, and a claim that cannot go
 * red goes stale silently instead (CodySwannGT/lisa#3944).
 *
 * What CAN be measured is whether the runtime is still the one the claim was
 * checked against. That does not prove the behaviour changed — only that nobody
 * has checked since, which is the honest thing to report and the whole of what
 * this pin does.
 *
 * ## Moving it
 *
 * Re-run both inline forms in a worktree-isolated session. Still refused: move
 * this pin, and say where. Permitted: those two cells are UNCOVERED, and #3944
 * owns the decision about which of them Lisa takes on.

 * human reading a transcript. A notice attached to a guarded tool call would

 *
 * ## Why it is recorded rather than counted
 *
 * A resume fires SessionStart again for the same session id. The recorded
 * version is what makes the second one silent, and recording the VERSION rather
 * than a flag means a runtime that moves twice inside one resumed session is
 * still reported the second time.
 *
 * Never refuses. The dependency is a reporting gap, not a live displacement,
 * and blocking a session over a version number would be a wall where an
 * observation belongs.
