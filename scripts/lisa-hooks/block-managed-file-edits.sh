# This file is managed by Lisa and IS replaced on each `lisa` run.
# Do not edit directly — durable changes belong upstream in Lisa.

# PreToolUse hook: refuse agent writes to files Lisa overwrites on every apply.
#
# Lisa ships templates in three modes, and only one of them is unsafe to edit:
#
#   copy-overwrite — see below; the harm depends on the file.
#   copy-contents  — Lisa APPENDS its lines; host content survives.
#   create-only    — skipped when the file exists; the host owns it outright.
#
# So this guard covers copy-overwrite and nothing else. Blocking the other two
# would stop agents editing files they are supposed to own, which is worse than
# the problem being solved.
#
# The name `copy-overwrite` is misleading, and two successive versions of this
# guard got the consequence wrong by trusting it. MEASURED, by mutating four
# files in a scratch project and running a real `lisa apply` against them:
#
#   scripts/lisa-gates.mjs   (ledger-tracked)  → SURVIVED
#   .lintstagedrc.json       (untracked, JSON) → SURVIVED
#   .prettierignore          (untracked, text) → SURVIVED
#   .yamllint                (untracked, text) → SURVIVED
#
#   Summary line: `Overwritten: 0 files` / `Out of date: 3 files (managed
#   templates changed; NOT updated)`.
#
# copy-overwrite overwrites an UNMODIFIED copy — it refreshes. It does not
# overwrite a host-edited one, in any population tested. So the harm is the same
# for both, and it is not deletion:
#
#   THE FILE SILENTLY FORKS. It keeps looking current while every upstream fix
#   stops reaching it. Nothing is lost, which is exactly what makes it invisible.
#
# Ledger membership changes the MESSAGE apply prints, not the outcome — tracked
# files get a provenance verdict naming the fork and offering
# `lisa-guard-capabilities:`; untracked ones get a bare "Out of date" warning.
# The refusal branches on that so the reader sees the words apply will use.
#
# Measured, not hypothetical. Nothing enforced this, so downstream copies were
# edited and then silently diverged: `classify-maestro-failures.mjs` reached
# 36,061 bytes in one fleet repo against 29,586 shipped, and five gate files in
# another stopped receiving upstream fixes — one over roughly 138 bytes of
# cosmetic change. The edits were made in good faith; nothing told anyone the
# file was not theirs.
#
# ## Why the path, not a banner comment
#
# 103 of Lisa's 145 copy-overwrite files carry a "managed by Lisa" header, and
# the other 42 CANNOT: 30 are `.json` (no comment syntax), 8 are `.gitkeep` /
# `.keep` placeholders, and the rest are bare-value files like `.nvmrc`. A guard
# keyed on the banner would miss every one of them, so this resolves the path
# against the installed package instead and covers all 145 regardless of format.
#
# Blocked signatures:
#   1. Write / Edit / MultiEdit / NotebookEdit whose target resolves to a
#      copy-overwrite template in the installed Lisa package;
#   2. Bash output redirection (`>`, `>>`, `>|`), `tee`, or an in-place `sed`
#      aimed at one — `-i`, `-i ''`, `-i.bak`, a cluster such as `-ni`, and the
#      long `--in-place[=SUFFIX]`. Reads never fire;
#   3. any of those inside a script the command EXECUTES — `bash edit.sh`,
#      `sh`, `source`, `.`, `bash < edit.sh`, and behind wrappers that carry an
#      operand of their own (`nice -n 5`, `timeout 5`, `sudo`).
#
# ## What signature 3 deliberately does NOT do
#
# A path is followed ONLY when the command EXECUTES it. `grep -n x edit.sh`,
# `wc -l edit.sh`, `git diff edit.sh` and a test run over it name a file as
# DATA, and following those is the known-wrong fix this guard family has already
# made once: it refuses ordinary reads and attributes a file's capability to a
# command that merely mentions it. Command POSITION decides. Taint does not
# propagate any further either — a path a followed script merely NAMES is data
# one file further out, not a third hop.
#
# ## Every agent surface reaches this guard, and Codex reaches it twice over
#
# There is no parity gap left to record. A note here used to record one, and it
# was wrong by the time anyone read it — through two wordings. The first named
# three surfaces; every one of those ports then shipped and the note stayed
# unedited. The second named Codex alone, and Codex had never been the gap
# either: the note and the check that read it were both looking in
# `src/codex/scripts/`, and `src/codex/hooks-installer.ts` says in its own
# opening remark that the linked-script layout that directory serves is RETIRED
# (CodySwannGT/lisa#3750).
#
# The note is deleted rather than trimmed, because a stale gap note is worse
# than none: it OVERSTATES the gap, and a reader who trusts it goes looking for
# three missing ports, finds two present, and cannot tell which third is real
# without redoing the measurement from scratch. AGENTS.md asks for a gap to be
# documented instead of silently dropped — that only works while the document
# is true.
#
# The deeper lesson is not "the note was stale". It is that a note asserting
# ABSENCE and a check deriving presence from ONE path shape agree with each
# other for free — the check read the same retired directory the note did, so
# it returned a clean tick on a claim that was false.
#
# Where each surface picks it up, so the next reader measures instead of
# guessing: Claude and Copilot from `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, Cursor from
# `hooks/hooks.json`, Antigravity from `hooks.json` via the `.agy.sh` adapter
# beside this file, OpenCode from
# `src/opencode/plugin-templates/lisa-block-managed-file-edits.ts`, and Codex
# from TWO channels rather than one:
#
#   `plugins/lisa/.codex-plugin/hooks.json` registers this guard directly, on
#   the Codex plugin channel.
#
#   `scripts/lisa-enforcement-fallback.sh` names this guard in its roster, and
#   `src/codex/enforcement-fallback-installer.ts` registers that dispatcher on
#   `PreToolUse` for `Bash|Edit|Write|apply_patch` — which is how Codex's
#   `apply_patch` writes are reached at all.
#
# Both Codex channels are measured rather than inferred — see
# `tests/unit/codex/block-managed-file-edits-codex.test.ts`, which drives the
# registered command as a subprocess in a synthetic host project: a Codex
# `apply_patch` or `Bash` redirect at a copy-overwrite template exits 2; an
# ordinary edit to a host-owned file exits 0.
#
# Two checks hold this paragraph to the tree.
# `tests/unit/hooks/managed-file-guard-parity-note.test.ts` fails if it goes
# stale in either direction — a port that ships without the note being
# narrowed, and a port REMOVED without it being restored.
# `check:guard-parity-notes` refuses an absence claim written back in, and now
# resolves Codex from those two registration channels as well as from a path
# shape, so it can no longer agree with a false note for free.
#
# Exemptions (allowed):
#   - `LISA_ALLOW_MANAGED_FILE_WRITE` set — the operator's explicit override,

#   - paths under `node_modules/` or `dist/` — vendored copies, not the host's;
#   - the Lisa source repository itself, where these files are the originals and
#     editing them is the entire point.
#
# The line below lets `lisa apply` tell a downstream copy of this guard that is

$consequence

WHERE IT GOES INSTEAD — take the first one that fits:

1. The change should apply everywhere. Edit the template upstream in Lisa and
   release it — \`/lisa:cross-pollinate\`, or an issue on CodySwannGT/lisa.
   That is the only edit that survives an install.

2. Only this project needs to differ. Look for the local escape hatch beside the
   file — Lisa ships \`.local\` variants for the configs that support one
   (\`eslint.config.local.ts\`, \`tsconfig.local.json\`, \`audit.ignore.local.json\`,
   and others). Those are yours and are never overwritten.

3. The behaviour is configurable rather than hardcoded. Check \`.lisa.config.json\`
   — the \`gates\` block in particular decides which checks run and what command
   proves each one, so a project can substitute its own task without touching a
   shipped file.

4. This project has deliberately FORKED this file and means to keep its own
   version. Apply already preserves the edit either way, so what is left to
   choose is whether the fork stays VISIBLE. Keeping it visible is the point:

   - **A Lisa-owned guard (hash-tracked).** Do NOT add it to \`.lisaignore\`.
     Apply preserves your version regardless, so ignoring it buys nothing — and
     it silences the standoff \`lisa doctor\` reports on every run, replacing a
     true warning with the line "Enforcement guards match the installed Lisa
     version", which is then false. A visible, resolvable fork becomes a silent
     permanent one. Instead declare what your version defends with a
     \`lisa-guard-capabilities:\` line; apply then classifies it \`host-ahead\`
     and says so by name, rather than reporting that it cannot tell.
   - **Any other template.** \`.lisaignore\` records the divergence where the
     next person can see it and stops the recurring "Out of date" line. It does
     not preserve the file — apply already does — so use it to DECLARE a fork
     you have decided on, never to quiet one you have not.

5. You believe this file should not be Lisa-managed at all. That is a real
   argument and it belongs upstream, not in a local edit that will be erased.

If a human explicitly asked for this edit, they can re-run with
\`LISA_ALLOW_MANAGED_FILE_WRITE=1\` set, which bypasses this guard.

    # spelling extracted NOTHING — `-i`, `-i ''` and `-i.bak` alike. The
    # `grep` matched; the strip pattern `sed[[:space:]]+[^|;&]*-i[^|;&]*` is
