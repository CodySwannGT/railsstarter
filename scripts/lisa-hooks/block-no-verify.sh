# PreToolUse hook for Bash: blocks commands that bypass git's verification hooks.
# Bypassing pre-commit/pre-push hooks (which exist for a reason) is blocked in
# all of its forms; the fix is to address the underlying issue, not silence the
# check. See feedback_never_no_verify in user memory.
#
# Blocked bypass vectors:
#   1. --no-verify, and any prefix abbreviation git would accept for it;
#   2. HUSKY=0 / HUSKY_SKIP_HOOKS=... — disables husky-managed git hooks;
#   3. core.hooksPath pointed anywhere but an allowlisted in-repo hooks dir;
#   4. --config-env=core.hooksPath=VAR, in both the one- and two-token spellings;
#   5. GIT_CONFIG_KEY_<n>=core.hooksPath env-var-style command-scope config;
#   6. GIT_CONFIG_PARAMETERS carrying core.hooksPath command-scope config;
#   7. the short `-n`, as a real argv token of a `git commit` — bare, or bundled
#      into a short-option cluster such as `-nm "msg"`;
#   8. a nested shell carrying any of the above as its `-c` command string,
#      including behind long shell options such as `bash --norc -c`;
#   9. `env --split-string` in EVERY abbreviation GNU accepts (`--s` upward,
#      with or without an attached `=value`);
#  10. those forms behind a wrapper that does not change what runs —
#      `command`, `exec`, `builtin`, `nohup`, `setsid`, and nested `env`, and
#      wrappers with an operand of their own (`nice -n 5`, `timeout 5`, `sudo`);
#  11. any of the above inside a script the command EXECUTES — `bash nv.sh`,
#      `source`, `.`, `bash < nv.sh`, and an interpreter a `find -exec` or
#      `xargs` puts at a command position.
#
# NOT vector 11: `bash -n nv.sh`. `-n` is noexec — the shell reads and parses
# the file, then exits without running a line — so a syntax check is the one
# shape that puts a path at a command position while executing nothing. It used
# to be refused, which made `bash -n` unusable on this file, on every husky
# hook, and on most of this repository (#3781). The distinction is noexec, not
# the program: `bash nv.sh` still executes and is still refused.
#
# The line below is what lets `lisa apply` tell a downstream copy of this guard
# that is BEHIND from one that is AHEAD. Byte comparison cannot: both look like
# "differs from mine", and guessing "behind" is how a fork's stronger guard gets
# silently replaced by a weaker upstream one. Refresh compares the two declared
# sets, and refuses to overwrite a copy declaring anything this one does not.
#
# Add a name here in the same commit that closes a vector. A hardening that
# forgets to is invisible to refresh, and shows up as an unexplained diff at
# review time instead of a named capability.

# Shell-token matching avoids false positives from issue bodies, heredocs, and
# commit-message prose while still catching quoted real argv values such as
# `git -c "core.hooksPath=/dev/null"`.
#
# ## The long flag is scoped to a git argv, and that is a WEAKENING
#
# `--no-verify` used to match as a bare token anywhere on the line. Measured
# against that matcher: `echo --no-verify` BLOCK, `grep -rl -- "--no-verify"
# scripts/` BLOCK. Both are correct to ALLOW — neither runs git — and both are
# now allowed. They are listed here rather than left to be rediscovered, because
# giving up a refusal is exactly the change that deserves to be written down.
#
# It was given up because it had to be. Vector 11 above reads FILE CONTENTS, and
# this file, every husky hook, and much of this repository carry the literal
# token in prose and in refusal text. An unscoped matcher plus reach refuses
# `bash` on this guard's own source and on the repository's own operations, on
# the first command. Narrowing was the prerequisite, not a cleanup.
#
# Scoped to a git INVOCATION, not to `git commit`: `git push --no-verify` skips
# pre-push and `git am` / `git merge` skip their own hooks. Only the short `-n`
# needs the commit scope. See `git_argv_disables_verification`.
#
# `HUSKY=0` and `core.hooksPath=` stay unscoped, deliberately — they are
# assignments that configure whatever git runs next, so they legitimately sit
# before the invocation or on an earlier line. See `token_bypass`.
#
# The short `-n` form used to be excluded here, and the stated reason was that
# "grep cannot distinguish a real -n option from -n in commit-message prose or
# an unrelated piped command". That was true of the matcher it was written for.
# It is not true of this one: the command is TOKENIZED, not grepped, so `-m "fix
# the -n flag"` is one token holding the message and `grep -n` is a separate
# command — the two cases the comment called inseparable are separated by the
# same machinery `--config-env` and `GIT_CONFIG_KEY_<n>` already depend on.
#
# A rationale that outlives the implementation it describes is worse than none:
# it reads as a considered decision and stops the next reader from re-examining
# it. Measured against real git, `git commit -n`, `-nm msg`, and `-anm msg` all
# skip pre-commit exactly as completely as `--no-verify`, and `-nm` is the more
# likely spelling in practice because it reads as an ordinary message flag.
#
# What the old comment got right is the part about `-n` being common, and that
# concern is answered by SCOPE rather than by giving up: `-n` is `--dry-run` for
# `push`, `--no-stat` for `merge`, and a line count for head/tail/sort/grep, so
# the match is confined to the argv of a `git commit` invocation and nothing
# else. See `git_skips_verification` below.

# `jq` used to be called unguarded here while `python3` two lines below was
# guarded. Under `set -e` an absent jq aborted the script with 127, and Claude
# Code treats any non-2 exit as a NON-BLOCKING hook error — so the hook that
# enforces "never --no-verify" silently permitted the very thing it exists to
# stop. It was not hypothetical: agent containers routinely ship no jq (that is
# why jq is now a pinned toolchain entry). The Codex variant of this script has
# always had the guard, so this was a parity gap rather than a design choice.
#
# Degrading to "allow" is still the right behaviour — a hook that cannot parse
# its input cannot tell a bypass from an ordinary command, and failing closed
# would block every Bash call on a machine missing an interpreter. What is NOT
# right is doing it quietly, so the operator gets one line on stderr saying the
# protection is off. A guard that is silently absent reads exactly like a guard
# that is passing.

# ── Reach: the contents of a script this command EXECUTES ──────────────────
#
# The guard used to inspect argv and nothing else, so `bash nv.sh` showed it two
# tokens, `bash` and a path, while the script it was about to run carried
# `git commit --no-verify` and skipped pre-commit exactly as completely as the
# inline spelling. Measured before this change: inline BLOCK, the same line one
# file away ALLOW — on bash, sh, zsh, `source`, `.`, an absolute interpreter
# path, and behind every wrapper.
#
# THE RULE IS TAKEN FROM parity-safety-net.sh RATHER THAN INVENTED HERE: a path
# is followed ONLY when the command EXECUTES it. `grep -n x nv.sh`,
# `git commit -F msg.txt` and `gh pr create --body-file body.md` name a file as
# DATA, and following those is the known-wrong fix that guard names by number —
# it refuses ordinary reads and attributes a file's capability to a command that
# merely mentions it. So COMMAND POSITION decides, never the presence of a path.
#
# Non-shell interpreters (`python3 x.py`, `node x.mjs`) are deliberately NOT
# followed. These matchers are git and shell syntax; running them over a Python
# or JS file buys mis-attribution, not coverage.
#
# Reach was not safe to add until the bare-token match was narrowed to a git
# argv — see `git_argv_disables_verification`. With the old unscoped matcher
# this guard would have refused `bash` on its own source, on every husky hook,

Blocked: this command bypasses pre-commit/pre-push hooks (--no-verify or its
short form -n, HUSKY=0, or core.hooksPath disabling). `git commit -n` and a
cluster such as `-nm "msg"` skip pre-commit exactly as completely as the long
flag. Fix the underlying issue (security audit, lint,
typecheck, tests, formatting) instead. If a fix is genuinely impossible, ask the
user to make the risk-acceptance decision and add a specific documented ignore;
never bypass the hook.
