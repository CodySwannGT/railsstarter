# PreToolUse hook for Bash: refuse to ARM auto-merge on a pull request that
# GitHub already says is blocked on review.
#
# WHY THIS IS A HOOK AND NOT A RULE
#
# Arming auto-merge is the moment an agent claims "this will merge", and the
# claim can be false at exactly that moment. Measured on this repository: three
# of five open PRs sat armed, fully green, with `reviewDecision =
# CHANGES_REQUESTED`. Nothing surfaced it. `reviewDecision` is not part of the
# check rollup, so the failing-check count read 0, the checks tab was entirely
# green, and three separate agents armed and moved on. One PR had been parked
# for hours before someone queried the field by hand.
#
# The stale case is the one actually observed, and it is the one prose cannot
# help with: the `base` ruleset sets `dismiss_stale_reviews_on_push: false`, so
# a CHANGES_REQUESTED review stays attached to the commit it was made on and
# pushing the fix never clears it, while `required_approving_review_count: 0`
# means no scheduled re-review will ever clear it either. The PR is blocked
# indefinitely and every check-based signal reads ready.
#
# WHAT IT CHECKS, AND WHY THAT AND NOT THE CHECK ROLLUP
#
# The defect class here is a probe that measures what it can see rather than
# what it means. A signal assembled from check-runs reports "ready to merge" on
# a PR that can never merge — that is precisely how this stayed invisible — and
# a code-review gate can arrive as a commit STATUS rather than a check-run, so
# a check-run-only query misses that too. So this guard does not look at checks
# at all. It asks GitHub the one question whose answer is the blocker:
# `reviewDecision`.
#
# `mergeStateStatus` is deliberately NOT read. It is computed rather than
# stored, reports UNKNOWN transiently while GitHub recomputes it, and was
# observed reporting CONFLICTING on two PRs minutes apart where one had a real
# conflict and the other merged cleanly with zero conflicted paths. Same field,
# opposite truths. A guard built on it would refuse honest commands at random,
# which is how a guard gets switched off.
#
# WHAT THIS GUARD DOES *NOT* CLAIM
#
# It answers "is there a standing review verdict blocking this merge?", not
# "can this PR merge?". The difference matters for one measured case that looks
# like this ticket and is not it: a PR opened against a base where reviews are
# disabled gets a review bot reporting `success` with the description "Review
# skipped: reviews are disabled for this base branch", and the repository's two
# review-evidence gates then FAIL. That PR cannot merge either — but it is not
# invisible: the failing-check count is 2, and any check-based signal reports it
# correctly. Only the individual bot's *conclusion* misleads, and nothing here
# reads conclusions.
#
# So that case is deliberately out of scope rather than overlooked, and the
# distinction is the whole reason this guard exists: `CHANGES_REQUESTED` shows
# ZERO failing checks. A guard that also tried to adjudicate check descriptions
# would be re-deriving gates that already run, and would start refusing commands
# on evidence CI already surfaces. The suite pins the boundary with a case, so a
# later reader can see it was decided rather than missed.
#
# THE SECOND VECTOR: A BASE REF NO RULESET COVERS
#
# The paragraphs above answer "is a review verdict blocking this merge?". They
# assume the merge has gates at all. On this repository that assumption is FALSE
# for every ref but four.
#
# Read live from the API, the `base` and `quality checks` rulesets both scope
# `conditions.ref_name.include` to exactly `~DEFAULT_BRANCH`, `refs/heads/dev`,
# `refs/heads/staging`, `refs/heads/main`, with no exclusions. A pull request
# based on ANY other ref — a `stack/**` batching branch, a feature branch —
# therefore has ZERO required checks. Every gate still runs; none of them can
# block. `gh api repos/<o>/<r>/rules/branches/main` returns fifteen required
# contexts; the same call for a stack ref returns `[]`.
#
# Two ordinary, permission-free acts turn that into a merged pull request that
# nobody approved and no gate passed. Both are intercepted here.
#
# 1. ARMING on an uncovered base. `gh pr merge <pr> --auto` on a stack base is
#    a claim that CI will decide, made where CI decides nothing. The merge lands
#    the moment the PR becomes mergeable, with no reader in the path.
# 2. RE-TARGETING a red pull request onto an uncovered base. `gh pr edit <pr>
#    --base stack/x` is a metadata edit any contributor or agent can make. It
#    requires no elevated permission, no `--force`, and no code change.
#    CodySwannGT/lisa#3922 records it executed by accident, by an agent
#    following an approved plan: a pull request BLOCKED by two genuinely failing
#    required checks was re-targeted, both blockers ceased to apply because they
#    were no longer required, the already-armed auto-merge fired, and the head
#    branch was auto-deleted leaving the work reachable from one ref.
#
# WHY THE CONFIGURATION CANNOT ANSWER THIS AND THE API MUST
#
# The resolved Lisa config reads `policy.protect: force_push=true`, which any
# reader takes for "force-push is blocked here". It is not a global switch — it
# configures a ruleset whose ref scope is those four refs. **A policy flag names
# an intent; only the ruleset's ref scope says where it applies.** So coverage
# is read from `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/rules/branches/{ref}`, which answers
# for the ONE ref in question and folds in org rulesets, repository rulesets and
# their exclusions. Nothing here reads `.lisa.config.json`.
#
# WHY RE-TARGETING READS CHECKS WHEN ARMING DOES NOT
#
# The section above says this guard reads no check conclusions, and for the
# review question that is right — `CHANGES_REQUESTED` shows zero failing checks,
# so a check-derived signal is the defect rather than the detector. The
# re-target question is the opposite shape: "does this edit remove a live
# blocker?" and a blocker there IS a check by construction. Reading them is not
# re-deriving a gate; it is asking whether one is currently biting.
#
# The condition is deliberately narrow, because re-targeting onto a stack base
# is a SANCTIONED batching workflow and a guard that refused it outright would
# be switched off within a day. A red pull request is refused; a green one is
# announced and allowed. The property protected is "a pull request something is
# currently failing must not be moved onto a base where nothing can block it",
# which holds whatever base it came from — so the current base is not consulted.
#
# WHAT THE REFUSAL ASKS FOR INSTEAD
#
# There is no env-var escape hatch here either, and none is needed: the
# acknowledgement the arming refusal asks for is dropping `--auto`. That is not
# ceremony. `gh pr merge <pr> --merge` on a stack base performs the merge at a
# moment when the advisory results exist and something can read them, which is
# exactly the mitigation #3922 shows is unreachable while auto-merge is armed —
# "the merge lands before any reader exists".
#
# SCOPE: ARMING AND RE-TARGETING, NOT MERGING
#
# A direct `gh pr merge` against a blocked PR fails loudly and immediately, so
# it is not the invisible failure this exists to close — and refusing it would
# also refuse the deliberate `--admin` override a human reaches for. Only the
# ARMING form is intercepted, because only arming produces a false report of
# success that outlives the command.
#
# The refusal is not a dead end: dismissing a genuinely stale review is a
# supported step of `lisa-drive-pr-to-merge`, and that is what the message
# names. There is deliberately no env-var escape hatch — an override the
# governed agent can set is theatre, and the real remedy is one command away.
#
# SUBSTRATES
#
# Arming has TWO shell spellings, not one. `gh pr merge --auto` is the common
# one; `gh api graphql` running the `enablePullRequestAutoMerge` mutation is the
# same act through the API, and a guard that recognises only the first reports
# safety about both. That is the failure mode CodySwannGT/lisa#3753 records one
# guard over — a control that sees a single substrate and speaks for all of
# them — so both are matched here. The mutation names a node id rather than a
# number, so the probe resolves it through `node(id:)`; a mutation whose id
# cannot be read at all FAILS CLOSED, because silence about an arming this
# guard could not inspect is this ticket's own defect in a new place.
#
# Recorded residual: the guard is registered `matcher: "Bash"`, so a structured
# tool call that arms auto-merge would not reach it. No MCP server provisioned
# here exposes auto-merge arming — the GitHub MCP merges directly, which is out
# of scope by the paragraph above — so the gap is currently unreachable rather
# than open. If one appears, the fix is #3753's: move the registration AND the
# internal `tool_name` gate together, since either alone ships a change that
# nothing fails on. Whether it earns its own `matcher: ""` group is a cost
# question that PR measured and bounded (~11.5ms per non-Bash call, with the
# whole broad set to stay under ~100ms); re-measure rather than assume.
#
# The line below is what lets `lisa apply` tell a downstream copy of this guard
# that is BEHIND from one that is AHEAD. Add a name here in the same commit that
# closes a vector.
