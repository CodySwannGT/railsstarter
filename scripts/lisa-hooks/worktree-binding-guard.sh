# PreToolUse guard for Bash/Write/Edit/MultiEdit, and PostToolUse recorder for
# EnterWorktree: refuse to act while the worktree the session was told it is in
# disagrees with the one it is measurably in (CodySwannGT/lisa#3864).
#
# The reconciliation lives in worktree-binding-guard.mjs beside this file. It
# needs per-session state, path resolution and git plumbing, and a bash
# reimplementation of any of that would be a second copy of the thing the guard
# exists to keep honest.
#
# This wrapper does three things and nothing else: probe its interpreter, pass
# the hook envelope through untouched, and return the classifier's exit code so
# a refusal is a refusal.
#
# FAILING OPEN, LOUDLY
#
# Claude Code treats exit 2 as a refusal and every OTHER non-zero exit as a
# non-blocking hook error, so a missing interpreter under `set -e` would exit
# 127 and permit exactly what this exists to stop. Degrading to "allow" is
# correct — a hook that cannot read its input cannot tell a displacement from a
# directory listing — but it must SAY so, because a guard that is silently
# absent reads exactly like a guard that is passing. Same reasoning as
# block-host-name-leak.sh.
#
# AGENT PARITY, AND WHY IT STOPS WHERE IT DOES
#
# `EnterWorktree` is a Claude Code tool, and the process-global session binding
# it rewrites is a Claude Code structure. Codex, Antigravity and OpenCode manage
# their own worktrees and have neither, so there is nothing on those harnesses
# for the reconciler to reconcile — no `.agy.sh` adapter is shipped for this
# guard, and its absence is a statement rather than an omission. The Codex
# variant carries the PreToolUse half because the displacement check is
# harness-agnostic: it only asks whether the directory a session is measurably
# in has changed since it last acted.

# Evaluate once per tool call when this guard is registered on both channels.
#
# Lisa reaches an agent through the repository dispatcher AND the plugin
# manifest, and where both are live the harness runs this guard twice for one
# tool call. `guard-dedupe.bash` short-circuits the second run ONLY when a
# byte-identical copy already ALLOWED this exact payload on this exact tool
# call; a differing vintage, a refusal, and a host with one channel all
# evaluate exactly as before. Nothing is de-registered by it
# (CodySwannGT/lisa#3814).
#
# Absent library means no dedupe, which is the pre-existing behaviour, so an
# older channel copy that predates it is unaffected.
