# PreToolUse hook for Bash: blocks structural JSON parsing with text tools.
# Text tools (grep/sed/cut/awk) break on valid JSON — multiline values, escaped
# quotes, reordered keys, nested objects — producing silently wrong output
# instead of errors. jq is the required tool for structural JSON reads and
# writes in shell. Promoted from host-rules prose to an executable
# control by the learnings gardener (issue #1787).
#
# Precision-first: this hook fires only on high-confidence STRUCTURAL parsing
# of a *.json input — never on plain text search. Blocked signatures:
#   1. `sed -i` (or an s/…/…/ program) applied to a .json file or stream;
#   2. `cut -d` with a structural delimiter (quote/colon/comma) on .json input;
#   3. `awk` field extraction (-F or a $N program) on .json input;
#   4. `grep -o` on .json input (value extraction, not search).
# A "json input" is a *.json argument, a `< file.json` redirection, or a
# pipeline stream originating from a .json file (e.g. `cat x.json | …`).
#
# Exemptions (allowed):
#   - any command that invokes jq anywhere (already compliant or mixed-legit);
#   - search-only usage: plain grep / grep -l / rg with no extraction signature;
#   - *.jsonl targets (line-delimited streams are legitimately line-tooled);
#   - heredoc payload text (stripped before classification).

# Evaluate once per tool call when this guard is registered on both channels.
#
# Lisa reaches an agent through the repository dispatcher AND the plugin
# manifest, and where both are live the harness runs this guard twice for one
# tool call. `guard-dedupe.bash` short-circuits the second run ONLY when a
# byte-identical copy already ALLOWED this exact payload on this exact tool
# call; a differing vintage, a refusal, and a host with one channel all
# evaluate exactly as before. Nothing is de-registered by it
# (CodySwannGT/lisa#3814).
#
# Absent library means no dedupe, which is the pre-existing behaviour, so an
# older channel copy that predates it is unaffected.

# Probe the interpreters before the first use. Under `set -euo pipefail` an
# absent jq does not merely skip the parse — the assignment below dies with
# 127, and 127 is not a refusal, so the guard vanishes and the command runs.
# Worse, that 127 used to outrank a sibling guard's 2 in
# lisa-enforcement-fallback.sh, taking a real refusal down with it.
#
# Degrading to "allow" stays right: a hook that cannot parse its input cannot
# tell a bypass from an ordinary command, and failing closed would block every
# Bash call on a machine missing an interpreter. Doing it QUIETLY is what is
# wrong — a guard that is silently absent reads exactly like a guard that is
# passing. Mirrors block-no-verify.sh, which already had this.

BLOCKED: this command parses JSON with text tools (grep/sed/cut/awk). Text
tools break on valid JSON — multiline values, escaped quotes, reordered keys,
nested objects — producing silently wrong output instead of errors. Use jq for
all structural JSON reads and writes in shell. Typical fixes:
  read a field:   jq -r '.field' file.json
  filter items:   jq '.items[] | select(.name=="x")' file.json
  edit in place:  jq '.key="value"' file.json > tmp && mv tmp file.json
If you are only SEARCHING text inside a JSON file (not extracting values), use
`rg <pattern> file.json` with no extraction pipe and this hook will not fire.
