# Do not edit directly — durable changes belong upstream in Lisa.

# PreToolUse hook for Bash: refuse a direct tracker-creation command that
# declares no readiness.
#
# WHY THIS IS A HOOK AND NOT A RULE
#
# The `ready-role-filing` rule says every filing declares either
# `build_ready: true` or a `human_gate:` reason, and that filings go through
# `lisa-track` / `lisa-tracker-write`. A conformance audit of the ~13 issues
# filed during one working session found 13/13 bypassed it, with zero
# `lisa-track` invocations — eight of them filed AFTER the rule merged, several
# by the agent that wrote the rule. Over the same window `Co-Authored-By`
# compliance was 50/50, because a husky `commit-msg` hook enforces it.
#
# Prose at the EAGER-RULE rung did not bind even its own author; the executable
# control was never once violated. Lisa's `learnings-ladder` rule says
# machine-checkable knowledge belongs at EXECUTABLE-CONTROL. This is that
# promotion.
#
# WHAT IT CHECKS, AND WHY THAT AND NOT "DID YOU USE THE SKILL"
#
# A Bash-level hook cannot observe call provenance. Any provenance signal an
# agent could carry — a flag, a marker, an env var — is settable by the very
# agent being governed, so a guard built on one is theatre. What the hook CAN
# observe is the artifact: whether the command about to run produces a
# correctly declared work item. So it enforces the checkable half.
#
# A creation command is refused unless it carries a readiness declaration:
#   - the project's configured build-ready role (GitHub label, JIRA/Linear
#     workflow state) resolved from `.lisa.config.json`, never hard-coded;
#   - on a tracker whose ready role is a STATE rather than a label, the
#     `lifecycle_role: ready` declaration the access layer resolves that state
#     from — because no flag on the mandated client can carry a state, and a
#     guard with no satisfiable declaration is a guard that teaches lying; or
#   - an explicit `[lisa-human-gate]` marker, inline or in the `--body-file`
#     the create is about to submit.
#
# WHERE IT LOOKS
#
# argv, the request payload (inline, in a `--data-binary @file`, or piped in
# over stdin from the same pipeline), and the contents of any file the command
# names. The last of those is what CodySwannGT/lisa#3484 was: the guard
# inspected argv and nothing else, so `bash /path/create.sh` showed it two
# tokens and the creation was one file away. Lisa's own `parity-safety-net.sh`
# tells agents to write payloads to a file and execute the file, so complying
# with Lisa's guidance produced the bypass.
#
# That is exactly the machine-checkable content of `ready-role-filing`, and it
# lets `lisa-github-write-issue` / `lisa-jira-write-ticket` /
# `lisa-linear-write-issue` through by construction, because those writers
# always stamp one. A blanket refusal would have blocked Lisa's own writers and
# left the factory unable to file anything.
#
# Creation signatures, per tracker CLI and the two ways around each:
#   gh issue create · gh api POST to .../issues · gh api graphql createIssue
#   linear issue create · jira issue create · acli … workitem/issue create
#   curl/http POST to api.github.com/…/issues, api.linear.app/graphql with
#   issueCreate, or …atlassian.net/rest/api/…/issue
# Reads never fire: `gh issue list`, `gh issue view`, `gh issue edit`,
# `gh pr create`, `gh label create`, a bare `gh api …/issues` GET, and a prose
# mention inside a quoted string are all allowed.
#
# STANDING DOWN
#
#   - No tracker configured (`.lisa.config.json` absent, or carrying no
#     `tracker`). There is no `lisa-tracker-write` to route through, so the
#     guard has nothing to redirect to. This is the bootstrapping case, and it
#     is DETECTED rather than asserted — the operator does not have to remember
#     an env var to bring up a new repo.
#   - `LISA_ALLOW_DIRECT_ISSUE_CREATE` non-empty in the hook's inherited
#     environment. This is the human operator's override, mirroring
#     `LISA_ALLOW_INSTRUCTION_FILE_WRITE`.
#
# The override is honored ONLY from the ambient environment, and is refused
# outright when it appears as an inline assignment in the intercepted command.
# That distinction is the whole point: a tool-call shell is fresh every time
# and its exports do not reach this hook's environment, so the ambient variable
# can only have been set by a human before the session started (shell profile,
# settings env block, CI config). An escape the governed agent reaches by
# typing one more token in front of the command it was just refused is not an
# escape hatch — it is the prose problem with extra steps.
#
# ## What this hook costs, and the number that would change the decision
#
# Registered `matcher: ""` since CodySwannGT/lisa#3753 — it runs on EVERY tool
# call, not only Bash. Measured on a developer machine at load ~8-26, 50
# invocations per row:
#
#     16.7 ms   enforce-team-first.sh          already `matcher: ""` today
#     17.5 ms   enforce-verification-gate.sh   already `matcher: ""` today
#     11.5 ms   this guard, non-Bash payload   what the broad matcher adds
#    112.3 ms   this guard, Bash payload       what Bash calls already paid
#
# So the broad registration was not novel — two hooks were already there, this
# one is cheaper than either, and it raises an existing ~34 ms per-call baseline
# by about a third.
#
# THIS IS A THRESHOLD, NOT A PRECEDENT. The argument is about the TOTAL cost of
# the broad set, so it does not transfer to the next guard: four more hooks
# moved to `matcher: ""` would put ~90 ms on every tool call and the answer
# flips. **Before widening any other hook's matcher, re-run the measurement and
# reconsider if the broad set totals more than ~100 ms per tool call, or if any
# single broad hook exceeds ~50 ms.** Do not cite these numbers for a fifth
# hook; measure again, because the number that matters is the sum.
#
# The cost is also irreducible rather than sloppy. A 9-line script containing
# only this file's preamble measured 11.7 ms, and padding it to this file's
# length changed nothing (11.5 ms) — it is process spawn plus one `jq`, not
# parsing. Moving the early exit further up the file buys nothing; the exit is
# already ahead of config resolution, which is what keeps the figure at 11.5
# rather than at the 112 ms the Bash path pays.

# ── The two substrates ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# A creation reaches a tracker two ways, and until CodySwannGT/lisa#3753 this
# guard saw only one of them. It was registered `matcher: "Bash"` AND gated
# here on `tool_name != "Bash"`, so an MCP tool call was refused entry twice
# over. MEASURED before the change, driving the guard with synthetic payloads:
#
#   ALLOW   mcp__linear-server__create_issue, undeclared      <- the defect
#   ALLOW   mcp__github__create_issue, undeclared             <- the defect
#   REFUSE  the same creation as `gh issue create` shell text <- control
#   ALLOW   an ordinary Read tool call                        <- control
#
# The two controls are what make those ALLOWs mean anything: the refusal proves
# the guard is live, the Read proves it is not simply refusing everything.
#
# **Widening the matcher alone would have changed nothing** — the call would
# arrive and this gate would still exit 0. Anyone who "fixed" #3753 by editing
# `plugin.json` would have seen no test fail and shipped a guard that still
# allows every MCP filing. The registration and this gate had to move together.
#
# The SHELL path below is untouched. A structured payload has no command line
# to tokenise, so it gets its own small classifier rather than being forced
# through a parser built for shell text.

  # suites are written to defeat.
  #
  # RESIDUAL, stated rather than hidden: a server whose creation tool is named
  # without a create-verb or without a tracker noun (`mcp__x__file_work`) is

# WHICH REPOSITORY'S VOCABULARY ANSWERS FOR THIS FILING
#
# The role above is the CALLING project's. For a same-repo filing that is the
# right question. For a filing addressed at a DIFFERENT repository — which
# Lisa ships a first-class, cron-driven path for in `lisa-persist-learning` —
# it is the wrong repository's vocabulary, and the guard demanded a token the
# target does not carry:
#
#   - a JIRA or Linear caller's ready role is a workflow STATE. Demanded as a
#     `gh --label` on another repo it is unsatisfiable, because that label does
#     not exist there and `gh` rejects an unknown one. Obeying the guard made
#     the command fail, which is not the same thing as being refused.
#   - a GitHub caller that renamed its ready lane demanded its own token of a
#     repository that never had it.
#   - a GitHub caller on the stock lane worked only because both repositories
#     happened to choose the same string. That is a coincidence, not routing.
#
# The one escape that IS satisfiable cross-repo, `[lisa-human-gate]`, is a lie
# about the item: it stamps a build-ready defect report as held for a human
# product call, and the target's build queue scans the ready role and nothing
# else. The report is filed and never picked up — precisely the incomplete
# handoff this guard exists to prevent, committed one repository over.
#
# So the target's own role answers, resolved from CONFIG rather than the
# network. A live `gh api repos/<o>/<r>/labels` lookup would be more general
# and is the wrong trade for a PreToolUse hook: a network round-trip on every
# intercepted command, and a new fail-open surface when it errors.

# The branch-specific half of the remediation, printed only for the branch that

# NEITHER PARAGRAPH IS AN ESCAPE HATCH, and that is deliberate. `3594` records
# that a PreToolUse guard whose escape the guarded agent can set is not a
# control, so nothing here is settable: the only inverses named are edits to
# the refused command itself, and performing either one leaves a genuine
# undeclared creation refused by the checks above. Re-quoting an unlexable
# creation hands it to the parsed path, which refuses it; naming a document to
# a reader files nothing, which is the whole point. The one true escape stays

THIS COMMAND DID NOT LEX, so it was judged by pattern rather than by parse. An
unbalanced quote is the cause, and an apostrophe in ordinary prose is the
measured one. The pattern cannot separate a sentence about filing from a real
filing hidden behind a trailing `#` comment, so it refuses both.

THE INVERSE IS EXECUTABLE: re-quote the command so it lexes, and run it again.
It is not a bypass — a re-quoted creation is handed to the full parser, which
refuses it unless it declares readiness the ordinary way.

A command whose every segment runs a known READER is not refused on this branch
at all, so `cat`, `grep`, `ls`, `cp`, `mv`, `git` and `echo` never reach it.

THIS REFUSAL CAME FROM A FILE THIS COMMAND RUNS. A path is opened only when the
command puts it in a COMMAND position; a program that takes it as data — `cat`,
`grep`, `ls`, `cp`, `mv`, `git`, a test runner — never reaches this branch. Two
inverses, both executable:

  - The file WRITES a payload locally and cannot transmit it (no HTTP client,
    no CLI, no process spawn): it is read as data, not as a filing. Drop the
    transmitting primitive, or slice the payload out of an existing file
    instead of restating it here.
  - The file produces no local artifact either — it is a DOCUMENT that quotes a
    creation rather than a program that performs one. Name it to a reader
    rather than to an interpreter; rewording its contents is not the remedy and
    does not converge.

BLOCKED: refusing \`$signature\` — this filing declares no readiness.

WHY: a work item filed without the build-ready role is an incomplete handoff.
Build-intake scans the ready lane and nothing else, so nothing will ever pick
it up: the write succeeds and the work still dies. An audit of one working
session found 13 of 13 issues filed this way, none of them through Lisa's
filing path. The rule saying not to do this already existed — it did not bind,
so it is now enforced here.

FILE IT THE SANCTIONED WAY — one of these three, always explicit:

1. The item is complete enough to build. Use the filing flow, not the CLI:

     /lisa:track "<what needs building>"

   which resolves or creates exactly one live leaf through
   \`lisa-tracker-write\` with \`build_ready: true\`, validates it before the
   write, and claims it. Complete means the \`work-item-definition-of-ready\`
   bar — reproduction, observed-versus-expected, Gherkin acceptance criteria.

2. A human product call is genuinely pending. Route the same way but pass
   \`human_gate: "<why a human must judge this first>"\` in place of
   \`build_ready: true\` — the two are mutually exclusive. The leaf is filed
   into the default backlog role, outside the lane build-intake claims from,
   and is deliberately NOT claimed, so it keeps attracting the human attention
   it was filed for. The hold is stamped so it is auditable rather than
   indistinguishable from an accident:

     Held for a human product call: <reason>.
     <!-- [lisa-human-gate] reason=<short-slug> -->

3. The item is a CONTAINER — an Epic, or any item whose state rolls up from
   its children. It is neither of the two above and must not pretend to be:
   \`leaf-only-lifecycle\` FORBIDS the build-ready role on a container, and a
   human gate it does not have is a durable false hold. It declares the third
   thing instead — the canonical container line, in place of a Target Backend
   Environment:

     ## Target Backend Environment

     None — container: state rolls up from children

   That declaration is refused alongside a by-design leaf type
   (\`type:Bug\` / \`type:Task\` / \`type:Sub-task\` / \`type:Improvement\`):
   an item cannot be a container and a leaf at once.

Filed, not ready, and no \`human_gate\` is the incomplete-handoff case, and
\`build_ready: false\` with no reason is the same omission with a value
attached. See the \`ready-role-filing\` rule for the full contract.

If you must run the CLI directly, the command has to carry one of the three
declarations itself:

$(declaration_hint)

   Or a \`[lisa-human-gate]\` marker in the body it submits, when a human
   product call really is pending.

   Or, for a container, \`None — container: state rolls up from children\` in
   that body, and no by-design leaf type on the command.

WHERE THE DECLARATION IS READ FROM: argv, the request payload — inline, in a
\`--data-binary @file\`, or piped in over stdin — and the contents of a script
this command runs. Moving the create into a file no longer moves it out of
sight, so the declaration can live wherever the create does.

$(remedy_hint "$remedy")

setting it inline on this command — an inline assignment is refused.

BLOCKED: refusing \`$signature\` — this filing declares no readiness.

WHY: a work item filed without the build-ready role is an incomplete handoff.
Build-intake scans the ready lane and nothing else, so nothing will ever pick
it up: the write succeeds and the work still dies.

THIS FILING IS ADDRESSED AT ANOTHER REPOSITORY: \`$target\`.
That repository runs its own build queue off its own ready role, so this
project's role does not answer for it — and this project's filing flow writes
to this project's tracker, so it cannot reach the target at all.

FILE IT THE SANCTIONED WAY:

1. An upstream defect or hardening report — the highest-signal report there is,
   because it is reproduced and attributed rather than guessed at. Use the
   upstream filing path, which composes a redacted, public-safe body through an
   allowlist projection instead of free-form prose:

     bunx @codyswann/lisa file-upstream --input <filing-event>.json

   \`lisa-persist-learning\` step 6 runs exactly this, headless, on a cron, and
   files the result with explicit \`build_ready: true\` so the target's queue
   picks it up.

2. If you must run the CLI directly, the command has to carry the TARGET
   repository's build-ready role — \`$roles\` — as the value of a \`--label\`
   flag. Configure it as \`hardening.upstreamReadyRole\` when the target renamed
   its lane.

DO NOT reach for \`[lisa-human-gate]\` to get past this one. It still satisfies
the guard — it is a real declaration — but on an upstream defect report it is a
false one: it stamps the item as held for a human product call, and the
target's build queue scans the ready role and nothing else. The report is filed
and never picked up, which is the incomplete handoff this guard exists to
prevent, committed one repository over. Use it only when a human product call
is genuinely pending on the target.

OPERATOR ESCAPE: a human can export \`LISA_ALLOW_DIRECT_ISSUE_CREATE=1\` in the
environment before starting the session. It is deliberately not reachable by
setting it inline on this command — an inline assignment is refused.

    acquired a second meaning -- being discussed -- the moment the feature

    then declares a hold on itself (CodySwannGT/lisa#3815).

    A declaration is POSITIONAL: the marker leads its line, behind at most the
    decoration above, with fenced blocks and inline code spans removed first
    because that is how the marker is written ABOUT. The same rule the intake
    matcher applies, so the two surfaces cannot disagree about one body.

    NOTE the direction here differs from the intake matcher's. There a match
    HOLDS an item, so a false positive parks work. Here a match ADMITS a
    filing, so a false positive is a hole -- which makes this the tightening
    direction on both sides at once.

# WHY THIS IS A TOKEN SCAN AND NOT A PROGRAM RESOLVER
#
# The first version of this classifier asked "what program is being invoked?"
# and answered it by stripping a fixed allowlist of wrapper programs. That
# question is unbounded, so the allowlist could never be complete, and every
# gap failed OPEN: an unrecognised prefix became the resolved program,
# classification returned "not a creation", and the guard allowed. A
# branch-enumerating probe found 36 fail-opens, including `nice -n 10 gh issue
# create` — and `nice` is POSIX, present on every host, so one prepended token
# defeated the whole control end to end.
#
# Enumerating command SHAPES had scored 21/21 against that same code. The
# lesson is the method, not the list: probe the parser's decision points
# (tokenise, split, locate, classify, declare), not the attacks you can think
# of.
#
# So the question is inverted. Instead of "what program is this?" — unbounded —
# the classifier asks "does this command line invoke a tracker CLI in a
# creation mode?", which is bounded by a tracker list we already maintain.
# Every token is examined; anything before the CLI token is irrelevant by
# construction. `nice`, `stdbuf`, `caffeinate`, `xcrun`, `arch`, `script`,
# `timeout`, `env -i`, `sudo -u`, `xargs -I{}`, absolute paths, and every
# wrapper nobody has thought of yet all collapse into one code path.
#
# THE DEFAULT ANSWER TO "I DO NOT UNDERSTAND THIS" IS NOW REFUSE.
# Tokenisation failure, a nesting bound, an unparsed operand: each refuses with
# an explanation rather than passing. An operator who hits a false refusal says
# so and the recogniser widens; an agent who hits a false allow says nothing,
# which is the entire problem.

# THE THIRD DECLARATION: THIS ITEM IS A CONTAINER
#
# The two declarations above are both illegitimate for a container, and the
# rules say so in as many words. `leaf-only-lifecycle` FORBIDS the build-ready
# role on an Epic — its state rolls up from its children, and a hand-applied
# role on a parent is the exact input that rule's claim-time arm exists to
# reject. `lisa-github-write-issue` says a container needs no human gate.
# So a guard with only those two arms could be satisfied for a container only
# by writing something untrue, and BOTH untruths corrupt data another control
# reads: a stamped role puts a container in the build lane, and a fabricated
# hold marker is a state change with no inverse that reads to every later
# observer as a real product hold. A guard that can only be obeyed by lying is
# worse than one that simply refuses, because the lie is indistinguishable from
# a correct filing afterwards.
#
# WHY NOT `--label type:Epic`
#
# Because a declared type is a CLAIM, and one that costs a leaf nothing: the
# item it produces still looks buildable, so the exemption would be a free
# bypass of the readiness requirement for anything willing to mistype itself.
# That is the shape of this repository's measured case where an allowlist added
# to harden a guard became the way around it.
#
# WHAT IS READ INSTEAD
#
# The canonical container declaration the `derived-branch-plan` rule already
# defines and `lisa-github-write-issue` already stamps, in place of a Target
# Backend Environment:
#
#   None — container: state rolls up from children
#
# It is a marker with no other meaning, so it is matched wherever the payload
# reaches — the asymmetry `HUMAN_GATE_MARKER` gets, and for the related
# reason. Reading the declaration the writer already emits is also what keeps
# the guard and the skill from drifting apart a second time: there is one
# string, defined in one rule, and both read it.
#
# It is self-limiting in a way a type label is not. Writing it costs the item
# its Target Backend Environment and its Branch Plan — the two fields a leaf
# needs to be built at all — so the declaration is only useful to something
# that actually is a container. A leaf that writes it does not smuggle a
# buildable item past the gate; it files an unbuildable one, in the lane
# `leaf-only-lifecycle` and `lisa-repair-intake` already sweep.
#
# The WHOLE canonical value, `None` included, not just the distinctive tail.
# Dropping the leading half would match ordinary prose about how a container's
# state behaves — including a bug report ABOUT this guard — and a declaration
# that ordinary prose satisfies is not a declaration. Whitespace-tolerant
# because a body file may wrap the line; dash-tolerant because an author
# retyping it by hand will not always reach for the em dash.

# REACH: THE COMMAND IS NOT THE ONLY TEXT THAT RUNS
#
# The classifier above asks the right question of the wrong text. It examines
# argv, and argv is not where a creation has to live:
#
#   bash /tmp/create.sh          # URL and `issueCreate` both inside the script
#   node wrapper.mjs --state x   # same, in JavaScript
#   curl … --data-binary @p.json # URL in argv, mutation in the file
#
# All three ALLOWED, verified by driving the guard with synthetic payloads
# (CodySwannGT/lisa#3484). The detection is a CONJUNCTION — an endpoint token
# AND a creation verb in the SAME inspected command — so moving either half one
# file away means the conjunction never forms. `bash <path>` shows the
# classifier two tokens, neither of which is a tracker CLI.
#
# It is not an oversight that an operator had to be clever to find. Lisa's OWN
# guards instruct agents into this shape: `parity-safety-net.sh` refuses
# heredocs and says "write the payload to a file with the Write tool, then
# execute that file directly", and `block-shell-json-parsing.sh` pushes JSON
# construction into `jq` scripts. An agent complying perfectly with Lisa's
# guidance lands in the uninspected path BY DEFAULT. The guards were
# individually reasonable and jointly self-defeating.
#
# The fix follows this file's own inverted method. Enumerating interpreters —
# bash, sh, zsh, ksh, dash, python3, node, bun, deno, ruby, perl, `./script`,
# `source`, `env bash` — is the unbounded question all over again, and every
# gap in it fails OPEN. So the question is inverted the same way the wrapper
# question was: instead of "which programs execute their operands?", the
# classifier asks "does this command name a readable file whose CONTENTS read
# as an undeclared tracker creation?" — bounded by the tokens actually present.
#
# THE COST IS STATED, NOT HIDDEN. `cat create.sh` and `git add create.sh` are
# refused too, because proving that a program does NOT execute its operand
# requires exactly the allowlist this file already refuses to keep. That is the
# documented direction of failure: an operator who hits a false refusal says
# so, an agent who hits a false allow says nothing.

# A PAYLOAD HELD AS DATA IS NOT A SUBMISSION
#
# The conjunction above — an endpoint AND a creation verb in one file — cannot
# tell a payload being WRITTEN AS TEST DATA from one about to be SUBMITTED.
# Measured (CodySwannGT/lisa#3943): a helper that assembles test fixtures, and
# holds a mutation body as a string constant it writes to a fixture file, was
# refused as "a tracker creation inside <path>". It submits nothing. The same
# helper rewritten to SLICE the payload out of an existing file was allowed —
# so the discriminator was the literal, not the behaviour.
#
# The behaviour that separates them is EGRESS. A file can only file an issue if
# it can hand its bytes to another host or another process. A file with no such
# primitive anywhere in it cannot submit whatever its constants spell, so the
# conjunction is reading data.
#
# BOTH HALVES ARE REQUIRED, and the second one is why this is not a hole. The
# exemption needs POSITIVE evidence that the file produces a local artifact
# (`LOCAL_WRITE`) as well as the ABSENCE of egress, so it is bounded to the
# measured population — a fixture writer — rather than granted to any file that
# happens to use a transport nobody enumerated. Egress is over-matched on
# purpose: every miss in `PAYLOAD_EGRESS` widens the exemption, so the list
# reaches for `.post(`-shaped calls and process spawning as well as named HTTP
# clients, and a file doing both is refused. That is the guard's usual
# direction of failure — a false refusal is reported, a false allow is silent.
#
# RESIDUAL, stated rather than hidden: a submitting file that ALSO writes a
# local artifact and reaches the network through a primitive no pattern here
# names is allowed. Nothing about `text_declares_readiness`, the nested shell
# scan, the unparseable arm, or the argv path is weakened — this reads only the

# DECLARING BUILD-READY WHEN THE ROLE IS A STATE AND NOT A LABEL
#
# `declares_readiness` accepted the build-ready role only as the value of a
# LABEL_FLAGS flag in argv. That is well-formed for a LABEL-based tracker and
# structurally impossible for a STATE-based one:
#
#   - GitHub's ready role is a label, labels are argv-native (`--label`), so
#     `flag_values` finds it and an honest command exists.
#   - JIRA's and Linear's ready roles are workflow STATES. The mandated access
#     path is raw `curl` to a GraphQL/REST endpoint, `curl` has no `--state`
#     flag, and the state lives in the request payload as an ID the guard
#     cannot resolve without a network round-trip it refuses to make.
#
# So on a Linear-tracked project the only declaration left that passed was
# `[lisa-human-gate]`, which this file's own comments correctly forbid for a
# build-ready item: it stamps the item as held for a human product call, and
# build-intake scans the ready role and nothing else. An honest operator had NO
# compliant command and exactly one dishonest one — a guard failing in the
# harmful direction, where complying is worse than not.
#
# The declaration accepted here for state-based trackers is the LIFECYCLE ROLE
# the access layer already consumes. `lisa-linear-access` refuses to accept a
# caller-supplied `stateId`; it takes `lifecycle_role:<ROLE>`, resolves it
# against config and the team's own state catalog through
# `linear-state-write-target.mjs`, and fails CLOSED when it cannot. So the role
# token is not decoration: it is the input that decides which lane the item
# lands in, and a command carrying it either places the item in the ready lane
# or refuses. That is the same epistemic standing as `--label status:ready`,
# whose effect also happens one layer down inside `gh`.
#
# Scoped deliberately: accepted ONLY when the configured tracker's ready role
# is a state, and ONLY for a filing addressed at this project's own tracker. A
# GitHub filing — same-repo or cross-repo — still has to carry the label,
# because for GitHub the label IS expressible and a second, weaker spelling

# enumerated precisely so a fix keyed on a list of interpreters fails. Failing
# closed on the unknown keeps that coverage.
#
# What the list buys is the measured population of #3705, every member of which
# is a well-known inspector: `git diff`, `grep -n`, `wc -l`, a `git grep`
# PATHSPEC, `sed -n '1,50p'`, and a test run. `git` is here wholesale because no
# git subcommand executes a named file as a program — `git commit -F <file>` and
# `git grep -- <pathspec>` both take the path as data.
#
# Test runners are here on purpose and it is the one entry worth arguing about.
# `vitest <file>` does run that file, so the executes-rule would follow it — but
# running a test is not filing an issue, and refusing a test run is the sharpest
# harm #3705 records, because it can block the verification of a fix while
# saying nothing about why.
#
# RELOCATION AND ECHOING ARE READS TOO, and leaving them off is what turned a
# false positive into a property of the repository (CodySwannGT/lisa#3683). A
# file that QUOTES a creation was already reachable by `grep`, `cat` and `ls`
# once this list existed — but not by `cp` or `mv`, so the file could be read
# and never moved, by any agent and by CI, for as long as the literal stayed in
# it. The measured case shows why "reword it" is not the inverse: the refusal
# recurred AFTER the content had been reworded, on a different file quoting the
# same command. None of these four executes an operand: `cp` and `mv` copy
# bytes, `echo` and `printf` write them to stdout. They are also the vocabulary
# `unparseable_reads_only` answers with when the text could not be lexed at all.
#
# RESIDUAL, stated rather than hidden: a reader NOT on this list is still
# followed and can still over-refuse. The set of read-only tools is unbounded,
# so this closes the measured population and not the class. Add names here as
# they are measured; do not invert the default to close it by fiat, or the
# executed-script reach that #3484 bought is lost.
#
# The copy/move/link family is measured, not inferred: `cp <a file that files>`
# was refused as "an unparseable command that reads as a tracker creation
# inside <path>" (CodySwannGT/lisa#3683, trip 5, reproduced in this guard's own
# suite). These four relocate bytes and never execute an operand, so following
# them can only ever over-refuse — and the harm is the propagating kind this
# ticket is about, because a file that quotes a creation then cannot be copied
# by any agent or by CI.
#
# `mv`, `ln` and `install` join `cp` as the same operation rather than as a
# guess: the list already carries whole families (`git` wholesale, `bat`/`xxd`
# beside `cat`) on exactly that reasoning. Path arithmetic and metadata tools

    COMMAND's behaviour. Measured refusals included `git diff`, `grep -n`,
    `wc -l`, a `git grep` PATHSPEC and a test run — every one of them read-only,
    and one of them blocked running the tests that would have proved a fix.

    `parity-safety-net.sh` already states the rule this restores, and names the
    opposite as the known-wrong fix (`origin/main`, lines 337-346 and 704-705):
    "Only a COMMAND POSITION can execute something. A path anywhere else is an
    argument, and an argument is data." `block-no-verify.sh:495-513`
    (`strip_command_prefix`) implements the same split with a fail-closed third
    state. Both live in this directory; this guard was the one that declined.

    NOT narrowed to shells, and NOT narrowed to an enumerated interpreter list.
    `file_creation` recognises a creation in any language, so `node wrapper.mjs`
    must still be followed — a measured fail-open in #3484 — and this guard's
    own suite drives it with a runner nobody enumerated, precisely so a fix
