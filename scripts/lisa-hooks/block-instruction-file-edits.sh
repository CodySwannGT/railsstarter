# PreToolUse hook: refuse agent writes to the session-instruction files.
#
# `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `.github/copilot-instructions.md` are the files
# every agent loads at session start. They are human-authored and curated on
# purpose — Lisa's own contract says so in two places:
#   - plugins/src/base/rules/reference/project-learnings.md
#   - plugins/src/base/skills/lisa-debrief-apply/SKILL.md ("CLAUDE.md is
#     human-authored ... apply never writes to any of the three")
#
# Nothing enforced it, so agents appended their own findings anyway: one fleet
# repo reached 949 lines of ticket-keyed trap dumps in `AGENTS.md` while its
# learnings ledger held 22. Every one of those lines is charged to the context
# of every later session in that project, forever. Prose did not hold; this is
# the executable control that does.
#
# Blocked signatures:
#   1. Write / Edit / MultiEdit / NotebookEdit whose target basename is one of
#      the instruction files;
#   2. Bash output redirection (`>`, `>>`), `tee`, or `sed -i` aimed at one.
#      Reads (`cat AGENTS.md`, `rg pattern AGENTS.md`) never fire.
#
# Exemptions (allowed):
#   - `LISA_ALLOW_INSTRUCTION_FILE_WRITE` set in the operator's runtime config.
#     This cooperative override does not authenticate conversation approval;
#   - Edit/MultiEdit replacing only bounded `<!-- LISA_` regions on both sides;
#   - paths under `node_modules/` or `dist/` — vendored copies, not the host's.

# Lisa's own bounded bridges write marked regions — the agy project-learnings
# bridge and cross-pollinate's rule section. The premise of their exemption, as
# originally stated, is that they "replace in place and cannot grow the file".
# This enforces that premise rather than trusting it.
#
# Both sides have to be a marked region and nothing else:
#
#   - old_string bounded proves the region really is on disk. Scanning the whole
#     payload was trivially forgeable — any caller could put `<!-- LISA_` in the
#     content it was WRITING and walk past the guard.
#   - new_string bounded is what makes it a replacement rather than an append.
#     old_string alone does not authorize anything: a caller can read a genuine
#     marked region, echo it back verbatim, and still smuggle unbounded prose in
#     after the closing marker. Requiring the written text to be exactly one
#     marked region — whitespace aside — leaves nowhere to put it.
#
# Every edit in a MultiEdit must qualify; one unbounded edit taints the batch.
# Write is absent by construction: it has no old_string and clobbers the whole
# file, which is precisely the unbounded case.

BLOCKED: refusing to write \`$target\`.

WHY: this session-instruction file is loaded into future agent sessions.
Appending incidental findings makes every later session carry those notes.
This hook checks write patterns; it cannot read or authenticate conversation approval.

If an operator already requested a standing-rule edit, that authorization is
enough for the requested change. Use the relevant topic file in \`.agents/rules/\`
when no other destination was specified. All six supported agents read that
directory through the existing \`AGENTS.md\` pointer. Edit it directly; do not
require learning capture, another ticket, or repeated approval for the same ruling.

If the operator explicitly named this guarded file, preserve that target and
use the runtime's authorized edit path, or report this remaining restriction.
Do not silently move the edit, switch tools to evade this refusal, or set an
override yourself. The existing operator-configured
\`LISA_ALLOW_INSTRUCTION_FILE_WRITE=1\` escape hatch is not proof of consent.

For an agent's own finding, first decide whether it is worth maintaining.
Decline one-off trivia and unnecessary rules. Durable project knowledge can
use \`/lisa:persist-learning\`; procedural knowledge belongs with its SKILL.md;
background belongs in existing project documentation. Use
\`/lisa:cross-pollinate\` only for a material, reusable upstream improvement.
