 * Report remote branches carrying work that was pushed and never submitted
 * (issue #3446).
 *
 * ## The state this exists for
 *
 * `lisa-git-submit-pr` lists **Push** and **PR Management** as separate steps
 * with nothing binding them: no atomicity, no post-condition, no terminal check
 * that a pull request exists when the flow ends. An agent that stops between
 * them — context exhaustion, a turn limit, an interruption, a refused call —
 * leaves a branch on the remote carrying finished work that is in no review, no
 * CI run, and no report.
 *
 * The skill's own `Never` list contained the rule for exactly this pair of
 * steps, pointing the other way: *"skip pushing before PR creation"* forbids a
 * PR without a push. Push without a PR was unprohibited and undetected.
 *
 * **The last signal such an agent receives is green.** The pre-push hook prints
 * `no pull request exists yet, so gates 4 and 5 could not be checked here — CI
 * will verify both`, which is accurate and reads as an informational pass.
 * Downstream the silence holds: the work item keeps its in-progress role, so
 * intake will not re-dispatch it, and nothing counts a branch without a pull
 * request. The state is unreachable by every other check.
 *
 * Measured when this was written: 15 such branches in one repository, roughly
 * 12,900 insertions, every one dated within a single day. Fifteen simultaneous
 * stops at the same step is not fifteen coincidences.
 *
 * ## What it reports, and what it deliberately does not
 *
 * Reported: a remote branch **ahead** of the default branch, with **no** pull
 * request of any state.
 *
 * A branch level with the default branch has nothing to submit. A branch whose
 * pull request already MERGED is an un-deleted leftover, not lost work — and
 * keying on "no OPEN pull request" instead would report every such branch in
 * the repository. Both exclusions exist because a check that reports everything
 * is one nobody reads, which is the same outcome as no check at all.
 *
 * ## The work item is resolved BEFORE the branch (issue #3904)
 *
 * Every signal above is a property of the **copy**: ahead, unpushed, untracked,
 * stale. None of them says whether the **work** survived, and that is only
 * visible in the tracker. Abandonment and uniqueness look identical from inside
 * a checkout, so a report built on branch facts alone reads superseded work as
 * unique — with maximum apparent urgency, because the more thoroughly stranded
 * a branch looks, the more it demands rescue.
 *
 * Measured in this repository: a branch one commit ahead of the default branch,
 * on the remote, with no pull request in any state — the textbook "just open
 * the PR" recovery. Its work item was CLOSED; the behaviour had already shipped
 * from a sibling item through a different merged pull request. Opening that PR
 * would have produced a duplicate for a reviewer to work out, and it could not
 * have been landed anyway: the commit gate requires a `Work-Item:` trailer
 * naming a **live** item, so the only routes left are a refusal or retro-fitted
 * attribution — which is falsified provenance, not a recovery.
 *
 * So the tracker is asked first and the verdict is the tracker's:
 * `superseded` (item closed — preserve, never promote), `unsubmitted` (item
 * live — this really is work awaiting a pull request), or `unresolved` (no item
 * could be resolved, which is reported as its own outcome and never folded into
 * either of the other two).
 *
 * ## Which side is ahead is measured, never inferred from the diff
 *
 * The sharpest case in the same sweep: a branch whose subjects were all absent
 * from the default branch, reading as dozens of stranded commits, whose pull
 * request had in fact merged days after the local ref last moved. It was
 * stale-**behind**, not ahead, and its `git diff` was symmetric and enormous
 * because it predated a large amount of the base. **A conflict resolution that
 * takes the branch side there deletes everything the base gained** — the
 * reading that feels like rescue is the one that destroys. Every candidate
 * therefore carries a two-sided `--left-right` count, so the direction is a
 * number that was read rather than an impression formed from a diff.
 *
 * Determinism: Node built-ins only, no `Date`, no `Math.random`. Branch,
 * pull-request and work-item facts come from `git` and `gh`; with neither
 * available the script reports that it could not look rather than that it found
 * nothing.

 * The work-item reference a branch is bound to, and how strongly.
 *
 * The trailer is asked first because it is the same binding the commit gate

 *
 * This used to ask git: `--format=%(trailers:key=Work-Item,valueonly)`. That is
 * the obvious tool and it is the wrong one. Git's parser sees only a message's
 * FINAL contiguous block of `Key: value` lines, and this fleet's convention
 * puts `🤖 Generated with Claude Code` boilerplate below the trailer, which
 * ends the block. Measured over non-merge commits that name an item: on a
 * single multi-agent branch git found none on 47 of 51; over full
 * default-branch history it missed 477 of 1,730. So the claim this docstring
 * used to make — "it is routinely absent" — was mostly a property of the
 * reader, not of the branches, and every one of those branches was ruled on
 * from a branch-name INFERENCE while its canonical binding sat in the message
 * unread. See the `work-item-trailer-definition` rule (#3747).
 *
 * The branch name remains the fallback for a branch that genuinely carries no
 * trailer, reported as an inference rather than as a fact. A branch naming
 * several items cannot be classified from one item's state: leave it unresolved
 * rather than choosing whichever commit git happened to print first.
