# Run Lisa's Bash enforcement guards when the plugin that normally provides them

# Every PreToolUse guard — block-no-verify, parity-safety-net,
# block-shell-json-parsing, block-instruction-file-edits,
# block-direct-issue-create, block-blind-automerge, worktree-binding-guard —
# is declared in the Lisa plugin. A cloud session
# installs plugins at session start from the marketplace the repository
# declares, and when that does not happen the container runs with
# `installed_plugins.json` empty and no enforcement whatsoever.
#
# That is how a dispatched session committed with `--no-verify`: not by evading
# a guard, but in an environment where none existed. The guards failed open, and
# silently, which is the worst of the three ways they could fail.
#
# A repository hook removes that plugin-delivery dependency. The project hook
# configuration is part of the clone, so the dispatcher is available whether or
# not a plugin ever installs. Each harness still applies its own project-hook
# trust policy before firing it.

# There is deliberately no skip here, and that is the whole point.
#
# This used to stand down when `installed_plugins.json` mentioned `lisa@lisa`,
# to avoid running every guard twice on a developer machine. The question that
# has to be answered is "are the plugin's guards running in this session?" and
# the file being consulted answers "has this plugin ever been installed, for any
# project, on this machine?". Those come apart three ways, and in each one both
# layers were off:
#
#   - Project-blind. The registry is keyed by plugin with an array of per-project
#     entries, so the grep matched the key. One project installing Lisa disabled
#     the fallback for every other project on the machine.
#   - Enablement-blind. `enabledPlugins` can set a plugin to false without
#     removing its registry entry, so the plugin guards were off while this file
#     believed they were on.
#   - Session-blind. Hooks load at session start; the registry is written on any
#     install or update. A plugin updated four minutes into a session leaves the
#     registry saying "installed" for the rest of it, with no plugin hooks
#     loaded. That is the one that was caught in the wild: a write to AGENTS.md
#     went through in a session where both guard copies exit 2 for that exact
#     payload.
#
# The first two are fixable with a better lookup. The third is not: plugin-hook
# liveness is not observable from a repository hook. CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT is set
# only for plugin hooks, and nothing on disk distinguishes "registered" from
# "loaded into this session". Any check against a file answers a different
# question and will drift from the real one again.
#
# So the guards run unconditionally. On a machine where the plugin hooks are also
# live that costs a duplicated sweep (~170ms) and a refusal printed twice, and
# that is the correct trade against enforcement silently switching itself off.
# Recovering it belongs in the guards — a marker keyed on session and payload, so
# whichever layer fires first does the work — not in a liveness guess here.


# Where the guards live depends on which repository this is.
#
# `plugins/lisa/hooks/` exists only in the Lisa monorepo. A host project gets
# the same scripts written into its checkout by `lisa apply`, because a host
# project whose plugin install fails has exactly the same hole and no
# `plugins/` directory to fall back on.
#
# Resolution is first-wins PER GUARD: `scripts/lisa-hooks/` shadows
# `plugins/lisa/hooks/` outright, and the shadowed copy never runs at all. So
# the aggregate below spans the six guards, not two copies of one guard. The
# distinction is worth stating because it decides what "the oldest copy
# governs" means here: a guard is governed by whichever tree is FIRST, never by
# whichever tree is newest, and the loser is silent by construction.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Vintage
#
# Enforcement resolves from THE CHECKOUT, never from npm. Publishing a guard
# fix and refreshing the marketplace does not reach the copy governing an agent
# working in a branch cut before that fix — and because the aggregate takes the
# strongest refusal, the oldest resolved copy governs (CodySwannGT/lisa#3205).
# One guard measured 22/22 on `main`, 22/22 in the installed clone, and 19/22
# on the copy actually in force on the machine the fix had been written on.
#
# None of that was observable from inside a refusal, which is the defect. A
# stale copy's block reads as the guard being WRONG rather than OLD, so the
# operator's available move is to route around it — and a guard routed around
# protects nothing. Dating every copy, and naming the producing copy in every
# refusal, turns that into a one-line diagnosis.
#
# Three constraints shape how the dating is done, and each rules something out:
#
#   - It runs on EVERY tool call, so nothing here may fork. Versions are read
#     with the `read` builtin, matched with bash's own regex, and returned
#     through globals rather than `$(...)`, which would fork a subshell per
#     lookup.
#   - It must work offline, and there is no network lookup anywhere below. A
#     guard that stalls or fails when the network does is a guard whoever it
#     slows down switches off.
#   - It compares only against evidence on the same disk. Staleness is claimed
#     only when a demonstrably newer Lisa can be pointed at, so the worst case
#     is silence rather than a fleet-wide false alarm.
#
# Bash 3.2 is the floor — macOS ships it as /bin/bash, and that is what the
# repository hook entry invokes — so there are no associative arrays
# here. There are exactly two possible trees, which is what makes plain
# variables enough.

# Result of the last read_json_version call. A global because command

#
# YOU CANNOT RETIRE A REFUSAL BY SHIPPING A FIX.
#
# These guards reach an agent by two independent channels: this dispatcher,
# registered in `.claude/settings.json`, and the plugin manifest, which
# registers the same guards individually. An agent sees the UNION of the two
# verdicts, so a TIGHTENING on either channel takes effect at once while a
# RELAXATION is inert until the slower channel catches up — the stale copy goes
# on refusing, and its refusal wins. What the operator sees is a guard blocking
# something `main` already permits, which reads as the guard being WRONG rather
# than OLD, and the move that reading suggests is to route around it.
#
# The two channels are two different files refreshed by two different
# mechanisms: `scripts/lisa-hooks/` when `lisa apply` runs, the plugin's own
# `hooks/` when the plugin updates. They drift. Measured on one machine on one
# day, two checkouts of the SAME repository resolved plugin 4.32.2 and 4.47.0.
#
# `plugin_tree` above cannot see any of that: it is repo-relative, so it exists
# only inside the Lisa monorepo, and in a host project the plugin actually in
# force is somewhere else entirely. The vintage machinery written for #3205
# was therefore blind to the channel it races. This resolves it properly, from
# the record the runtime itself keeps.
#
# WHAT THIS RECORD CAN AND CANNOT ANSWER. The header above explains why a
# previous stand-down keyed on `installed_plugins.json` was removed: the record
# is project-blind as it was read then, enablement-blind (`enabledPlugins` can
# switch a plugin off without removing its entry), and session-blind (hooks load
# at session start; the record is rewritten on any install). Those defeat a
# LIVENESS question — "are the plugin's guards running in this session?" — and
# nothing on disk answers that one.
#
# This asks a different question: "what VINTAGE is the plugin installed for this
# project?" The record answers that directly, and the project-blindness is
# resolved by keying the lookup on this repo root rather than on the plugin name.
# The remaining two blindnesses bound the claim rather than break it: a skew
# reported here is a real difference between two copies on disk, but a disabled
# or not-yet-loaded plugin may mean those copies are not both firing right now.
# So the wording below reports what is INSTALLED and what the union WOULD mean,
# and never asserts that both channels are live. Reporting is also why this may
# use the record at all where a stand-down may not: an over-reported skew costs
# a line of notice, while an over-confident stand-down costs enforcement.

# Verdict of the last classify_channel_skew call: agree | skew | undetermined.
#
# Three answers, never two. "The channels agree" and "I could not read one of
# them" are DIFFERENT facts, and collapsing them is how a probe reports success
# while measuring nothing.
#
# THIS PROBE REPORTS. IT NEVER BLOCKS. A permitted command stays permitted
# whatever the verdict, and the finding goes into the once-per-session notice.
# That is a decision, not an oversight, so here is the reasoning for whoever
# comes to change it:
#
#   - The two error directions have asymmetric costs. An over-reported skew
#     costs a line of notice; an over-confident stand-down costs enforcement.
#     When the costs are that lopsided the direction is settled without needing
#     to argue about likelihood.
#   - Failing closed on `undetermined` would refuse work on every host with no
#     `installed_plugins.json` — containers, fresh clones, non-Claude runtimes.
#     That is a large population with nothing wrong with it, and refusing them
#     is a bigger fault than the one being detected.
#   - What is detected is two copies at different AGES, not a compromised
#     guard. Blocking on it turns a diagnostic into an outage.
#   - And the practical argument, which beats the principled one: skew is the
#     common case on a developer machine right now, so as a blocker this would
#     be a permanent stop-work and the first response would be to switch it
#     off. A blocker everyone turns off protects nothing.
#
# Pinned by the test named "lets a permitted command through whatever the
# verdict is", which asserts exit 0 on both the skew and undetermined arms.

# Zero guards resolved is a refusal, not a pass.

# Six misses used to leave the status at 0, so nothing distinguished "every

# fail-open this file was written to close, reproduced one layer down: a host
# whose `scripts/lisa-hooks/` was never written by `lisa apply`, or was
# deleted, or drifted — precisely the state this file exists for — got the same
# green as a clean session.
#
# Refusing rather than warning is a deliberate choice between two imperfect
# options, and the reasons are these.
#
#   - The hook entry and the guards ship from the SAME `lisa apply`:
#     `.claude/settings.json` or `.codex/hooks.json` registers this dispatcher and
#     `all/copy-overwrite/scripts/lisa-hooks/` writes the guards. "Registered
#     but no guards" is therefore never a configuration anyone chose; it is
#     always drift, deletion, or a partial apply.
#   - Warning on exit 0 is barely louder than silence. Claude Code shows a
#     zero-status hook's output to the user in transcript mode only and never
#     to the agent, so "fail loud, exit unchanged" would have left the failure
#     very nearly as invisible as it already was while claiming to have fixed
#     it.
#   - The blocking cost is bounded and recoverable without the agent. The
#     refusal below names the guards, both searched paths, and the one command
#     that repairs it, which a human runs in a terminal — no tool call needed.
#
# The scope is deliberately "zero", not "fewer than six". A partial resolution
# means some enforcement ran, and version skew across an interrupted apply is a
# real enough way to reach it that refusing there would trade a silent hole for
# a noisy outage. What a partial resolution DOES get is the notice below, which
# names both the vintage of each tree that resolved and every guard that did
# not.

Blocked: Lisa's enforcement guards are missing from this repository, so this
tool call was checked by nothing at all.

This hook is registered in the repository hook configuration but resolved none
of the guards it dispatches: $missing

Searched:
  $host_tree/<guard>.sh
  $plugin_tree/<guard>.sh

Refused rather than allowed on purpose. A dispatcher that resolves nothing is
indistinguishable from one that was never installed, and letting the call
through would be the silent fail-open this hook exists to close.

To repair, run this in a terminal outside the agent session:

#
# The first draft of this fired whenever a resolved tree was behind, on the
# reasoning that a current checkout would stay silent. Measured on this
# repository and this fleet, that reasoning is wrong twice over:
#
#   - `main` cut 80 releases in 24 hours, median gap 10 minutes. "Behind the
#     newest Lisa on this disk" is the DEFAULT state of a checkout within
#     minutes of being cut, through nothing anyone did wrong.
#   - Measured once across the host checkouts on one fleet: of those that
#     resolved guards at all, every one was behind or undateable and none was
#     current, several by a whole MAJOR — while a larger number resolved NO

# That second reading used to be written here as a set of counts, and that was
# the wrong place for it. A number in a comment is a measurement, not a monitor:
# it was true on the day it was taken and nothing re-took it, so the drift after
# that date was unobserved — which is the same defect the number documents. The
# counts are therefore not restated here. Re-derive them:
#
# Run these FROM A LISA MONOREPO CHECKOUT — the census and the fleet roster are
# Lisa-monorepo artifacts, and this comment travels into host projects where
# neither exists. The script wrapper builds `dist/` first, which a fresh clone
# does not have:
#
#   bun run lisa:enforcement-census              # roster on this machine
#   bun run lisa:enforcement-census -- --redact  # safe to quote publicly
#
# In a host project the local half of the same question is `lisa doctor`, which
# reports what THIS checkout resolves and needs no roster.
#
# The census reports and never gates, and it keeps "resolves NO guard" apart
# from "resolves something old" — different failures, different remedies, and
# folding them is what made the unenforced checkouts easy to miss
# (CodySwannGT/lisa#3490). `lisa doctor` carries the same finding for the single
# checkout it is run in.
#
# So no distance threshold rescues it — even the strictest version predicate is
# permanently true across the fleet. The noise is the REPETITION, not the
# distance: a banner on every tool call for a whole session is a banner people
# learn to skip past, and the guard whose output gets skipped past is the guard
# that stops being read.
#
# The rate limit therefore goes on repetition and the distance threshold stays
# at zero. Once per session an operator is told; every refusal after that still
# carries the full vintage in its attribution line, which costs nothing because
# it only prints when something has already been blocked.
#
# Failure is noisy, never silent: no session id, or a state directory that
# cannot be written, degrades to printing every time rather than to printing
# never.

# A shared temp directory is not a trust boundary. Give each user a directory,
# create it privately, and use it only when every parent is protected from
# replacement by another uid. A private leaf is not enough below an arbitrary
# non-sticky shared TMPDIR: another user could replace that parent between the
# checks below. Root- or caller-owned parents are acceptable; any parent that
# grants group or other write access must also carry the sticky bit.
#
# The two `stat` spellings must be asked for the SAME twelve bits, and getting
# that wrong is invisible because each platform only ever runs its own branch.
# BSD `%Lp` renders the low NINE bits and drops setuid/setgid/sticky entirely:
#
#   stat -f '%Lp' <a 1777 dir>  ->  777    <- sticky gone
#   stat -f '%p'  <a 1777 dir>  ->  41777  <- sticky present, plus file type
#   stat -c '%a'  <a 1777 dir>  ->  1777   <- sticky present (GNU includes it)
#
# So under `%Lp` the sticky test below is `777 & 1000`, which is zero for every
# directory on the machine — the exemption was unreachable on macOS and the
# whole `&& [ ... 8#1000 ] -eq 0` clause was dead code there. The same logical
# root was therefore trusted on Linux and rejected on macOS, and since CI is
# Linux the stricter platform was the one nobody specified and nobody tests on
# (CodySwannGT/lisa#3691).
#
# `%p` restores the bit and adds the file type above it, so the mask normalizes
# both spellings to one value and the arithmetic below has a single meaning:
# `41777 & 7777` and `1777 & 7777` are both 1777.
