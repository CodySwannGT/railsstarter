 * lisa-lint-staged-preflight — prove every tool lint-staged is about to run can
 * actually be started, before lint-staged gets the chance to swallow the answer.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/lisa-lint-staged-preflight.mjs --config .lintstagedrc.json
 *   node scripts/lisa-lint-staged-preflight.mjs --config=.lintstagedrc.json
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * `lint-staged` reports **exit 0** when a task's executable cannot be spawned
 * with `ENOEXEC`, while printing `[FAILED] spawn ENOEXEC` to the terminal. The
 * asymmetry is the whole problem, and it is what defeats the intuition that a
 * broken tool would get noticed. Measured with one harness, three tasks,
 * everything else held constant:
 *
 * | task                                            | 16.2.7 | 16.4.0 | 17.3.0 |
 * | ----------------------------------------------- | ------ | ------ | ------ |
 * | script exits 1 (ordinary failure)               | 1      | 1      | 1      |
 * | executable absent entirely (`ENOENT`)           | 1      | 1      | 1      |
 * | present, `chmod +x`, not executable (`ENOEXEC`) | 1      | **0**  | **0**  |
 *
 * A *missing* tool is caught. A tool that is present but unrunnable is not.
 *
 * That is precisely the state some published tools leave behind. A package
 * whose real binary is materialized during `postinstall` installs a
 * shebang-less placeholder shim first; the shim is written to fail loudly and
 * explain itself, and it would, because it `exit 1`s. lint-staged spawns
 * without a shell, so no shebang plus no shell means the kernel returns
 * `ENOEXEC` before the shim's own `exit 1` can ever run. Skip `postinstall` —
 * which is a route agents take routinely — and the task runs, reports nothing,
 * and blocks nothing, while the commit proceeds.
 *
 * ## Why hardening the hook could not fix it
 *
 * Worth stating, because it is the obvious first response. The hook already
 * captures lint-staged's status and exits on it. No exit-code check can catch
 * a process that reports `0` for work it did not do. The answer has to arrive
 * *before* the handoff, from something that spawns the tools itself.
 *
 * ## What "invocable" means here, and why it is measured rather than inferred
 *
 * This guard does not read the file's first bytes looking for a shebang or an
 * object-file magic number and reason about what the kernel would do with them.
 * On POSIX it spawns each executable, shell-less, as lint-staged will, and
 * watches for the `spawn` event. `ENOEXEC`, `ENOENT` and `EACCES` all arrive as
 * an `error` event instead, which is the signal. The probe passes when — and
 * only when — the operating system really started the process. Windows also
 * requires where.exe to resolve the tool before accepting its shell startup.
 *
 * `--version` is the probe argument because every tool Lisa ships in
 * `.lintstagedrc.json` answers it instantly. The exit code is deliberately
 * ignored: a tool that rejects `--version` still *started*, which is the entire
 * question. A tool that hangs is also a pass for the same reason — it started —
 * so the probe kills it and moves on.
 *
 * ## Silence is not the success signal
 *
 * The defect being fixed is a control reporting success for work it no longer
 * performs, so this file refuses to be a second instance of it:
 *
 * - It prints one line per executable it probed and a count. A run that proved
 *   nothing cannot look like a run that proved everything.
 * - A config it cannot read, cannot parse, or whose shape it does not
 *   understand is a FAILURE, never a quiet pass.
 * - A config that declares no tasks is a FAILURE: lint-staged would prove
 *   nothing, and "nothing to check" is exactly the report this guard exists to
 *   stop trusting.
 * - Extracting zero executables from a config that has tasks is a FAILURE.
 * - Executable-name extraction that disagrees with lint-staged's own
 *   tokenization can only produce a name that fails to spawn, which this guard
 *   reports loudly. It has no path to a silent pass.
