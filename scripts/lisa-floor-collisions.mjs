/**
 * @file Fail when a security override can be collapsed into a weaker floor.
 *
 * npm and bun both let an override be written as `$name`, meaning "use whatever
 * the root package pins this to". bun does not merely permit that form — it
 * REWRITES to it, on every `bun install`, whenever an override names a package
 * the project also depends on directly. The override stops carrying its own
 * floor and adopts the dependency line's.
 *
 * That is fine when the two agree. It is a silent security regression when the
 * dependency line is lower, which is the normal case: an override exists
 * *because* the direct range was too permissive. Observed in
 * acmeorgc/frontend on bun 1.3.11, from a clean tree:
 *
 *   "postcss": ">=8.5.18"  ->  "$postcss"   with devDependencies ^8.5.0
 *   "prettier": "3.8.3"    ->  "$prettier"  with devDependencies ^3.3.3
 *
 * postcss 8.5.0 is inside the range GHSA patches at 8.5.18. The rewrite reads
 * as a tidy-up in the diff, recurs on every install, and defeats any attempt to
 * restore the floor by hand.
 *
 * This check is deliberately OFFLINE and deterministic. It asks one structural
 * question — can this override be collapsed into something weaker? — and needs
 * no advisory lookup to answer it, so it runs in every project's CI in
 * milliseconds and cannot go quiet when a network call fails. Whether a given
 * floor is high enough for current advisories is a separate question, answered
 * by check-security-floors.mjs against the advisory database.
 *
 * The fix it asks for is always the same: raise the dependency line to the
 * floor. Removing the override is the wrong move — it is what carries the floor
 * to transitive copies, which is the case it was written for.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   lisa-floor-collisions.mjs [--manifest package.json] [--json]
 *
 * Exit 1 when any override would collapse to a weaker range.

/**
 * The version triple leading a range branch, anchored.
 *
 * Anchored with a `\D*` prefix rather than searched with a bare
 * `/(\d+)\.(\d+)\.(\d+)/`. An UNANCHORED search re-attempts at every position,
 * and `\d+` inside it gives the engine something to give back at each one, so
 * runtime is super-linear in the length of the input — S5852. `\D*` cannot
 * match a digit, so it has exactly one viable length and the whole match is
 * one left-to-right pass.
 *
 * The prefix it skips is the comparator, which is the only thing that ever
 * precedes the number in a branch: `>=1.2.3`, `^1.2.3`, `~1.2.3`, `1.2.3`,
 * `>=1.2.3 <2`.
 *
 * The prefix is a CLOSED class of comparator characters rather than "anything
 * that is not a digit", because `\D*` made every digit-bearing string look like
 * a range. `file:../pkg2` parsed as a floor of `2.0.0`, and `collisions()`
 * applies {@link isIncomparable} to the DEPENDENCY line only — so a protocol
 * override carrying a digit invented a floor and reported a collision that does
 * not exist. A false alarm in this check is the failure that gets it switched
 * off, which costs the false negatives it was written to prevent.
 *
 * Minor and patch are OPTIONAL, and that is load-bearing rather than tidy.
 * Demanding a full `x.y.z` made `^8` and `~1.2` read as carrying no floor at
 * all, which is not a near-miss — it is the opposite of the truth. `^8` permits
 * `>=8.0.0`, and calling that floorless broke this check in both directions at
 * once: an override written `^8` was skipped on the reasoning that it had
 * nothing to lose, and a dependency written `~1.2` was compared as `0.0.0` and
 * lost to everything. The first is a false negative in a security check, which
 * this file's own comments name as the failure mode it is built to avoid.
 *
 * A partial version's absent parts are zero because that is what the range
 * means: `^8` is `>=8.0.0 <9.0.0` and `1.x` is `>=1.0.0 <2.0.0`. Only the lower
 * bound is read here, so the upper half costs nothing to ignore.
 *
 * This parser deliberately uses no version-shaped regular expression. The
 * collision gate consumes dependency text supplied by a repository, so even a
 * bounded-looking optional-group expression becomes an avoidable ReDoS review
 * burden. A tiny left-to-right scanner is both clearer and constant-work per
 * input character.

 * security check, so every branch is measured and the lowest wins.
 *
 * An alias spec (`npm:other-pkg@^1.2.3`) versions a different package

 * agreed with it, which is how an override written that way went unchecked.
 *
 * `null` therefore means only "no floor was read here", and callers must not
