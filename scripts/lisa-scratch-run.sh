# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Rails scratch supervisor — run-scoped scratch ownership with an outside
# cleanup authority that survives the tested process.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHY THIS IS SHELL AND NOT NODE
#
# A Rails repository is not required to have Node, npm, Bun, Yarn, a populated
# `node_modules`, or a network at test runtime. The Node-managed scratch
# supervisor cannot be reused here for exactly that reason. This file assumes
# only what the routes it wraps already assume: a POSIX shell, coreutils/BSD
# userland (`ps`, `mkdir`, `rm`, `date`, `od`), and Ruby/Bundler for the payload
# itself. It never fetches anything.
#
# USAGE
#
#   sh scripts/lisa-scratch-run.sh --suite <label> -- <command> [args...]
#
# WHAT IT GUARANTEES
#
#   1. Authority precedes allocation. Before the payload can allocate one byte
#      of scratch, a separate cleanup authority process — outside the payload's
#      process group, and outside this shell's — has read and acknowledged the
#      exact run token, the canonical run root, the run root's filesystem
#      identity (device + inode), the suite label, the payload's process-group
#      identity, and the payload's process-birth identity. The payload is held
#      at a gate until that acknowledgement lands. An arming or acknowledgement
#      failure REFUSES: the payload never executes.
#   2. Cleanup survives the payload. Pass, fail, timeout, SIGTERM, SIGINT,
#      SIGHUP, payload SIGKILL, and foreground-supervisor SIGKILL all end with
#      the owned process group boundedly drained and the owned run root absent,
#      done by this invocation's own already-armed authority. No successor run
#      is started and no global sweep is performed.
#   3. Only what this invocation owns is touched. The authority signals exactly
#      one process group — the one it acknowledged, re-verified by birth
#      identity so PID reuse cannot broaden it — and deletes exactly one root,
#      re-verified by token and by device+inode so a swap cannot broaden it. An
#      external database service is never signalled, stopped, reset, or deleted.
#   4. Ambiguity fails closed. Traversal, symlinked roots, inode swaps, owner
#      token changes, malformed or oversized markers, PID reuse, birth
#      mismatch, and foreign quarantine names all exit nonzero with a reason.
#   5. A fixture leak fails the suite. Unregistered direct children left under
#      the payload's temp root are reported with the suite label, the leaked
#      count, and the sorted leaked basenames, and make the route exit nonzero.
#      A red payload verdict is never overwritten by the leak verdict, and a
#      green payload never masks a leaking child.
#
# ENVIRONMENT
#
#   LISA_SCRATCH_BASE               Temp base. Default: $TMPDIR, else /tmp.
#   LISA_SCRATCH_REGISTERED_PREFIXES
#                                   Comma-separated basename prefixes that are
#                                   batch-cleaned instead of reported as leaks.
#                                   Default: "lisa-".
#   LISA_SCRATCH_LEAK_GATE          enforce (default) | report | off.
#   LISA_SCRATCH_ARM_TIMEOUT_MS     Arming handshake budget, in ms. Default 15000.
#   LISA_SCRATCH_GATE_TIMEOUT_MS    How long the held payload waits for the gate
#                                   to open before refusing. Default 300000.
#   LISA_SCRATCH_AUTHORITY_REFUSE   Conformance control. When 1, the cleanup
#                                   authority declines to acknowledge. The run
#                                   must then REFUSE before the payload executes.
#                                   It can only turn a run into a refusal; it can
#                                   never let one through unsupervised.
#   LISA_SCRATCH_DRAIN_MS           SIGTERM→SIGKILL drain budget. Default 5000.
#   LISA_SCRATCH_TRACE              Append lifecycle events to this file. The
#                                   file order IS the ordering proof.
#   LISA_SCRATCH_INHERIT_STDIN      1 to give the payload this shell's stdin.
#                                   Default: /dev/null (avoids SIGTTIN on a
#                                   background process group).

#   `setsid`. Always present on Linux, absent from stock Darwin. It forks
