/**
 * Deterministic gate that every THIRD-PARTY GitHub Action this repository uses
 * — in its own workflows and in the workflow templates it seeds into consumers
 * — is referenced by a full 40-character commit SHA (issue #3585).
 *
 * A mutable ref is not a version. `@master`, `@main`, `@v1` and `@v0.9.0` are
 * pointers that resolve, at job start, to whatever the upstream owner has
 * pushed at that instant, and for a third-party action that owner is a
 * stranger. A tag is mutable by definition — `git push --force` moves it — and
 * a floating major is *designed* to move.
 *
 * The exposure is not theoretical here. When this gate was written the tree
 * held 19 distinct third-party references, none pinned, thirteen of them in
 * jobs holding a credential:
 *
 *   - `snyk/actions/node@master` with the Snyk token in the same step's `env:`;
 *   - `fossas/fossa-action@main` handed the FOSSA key as an input;
 *   - `noliran/branch-based-secrets@v1`, whose ENTIRE FUNCTION is to resolve
 *     repository secrets into the job environment, in the publish path;
 *   - `GeoWerkstatt/create-jira-release@v1`, handed a webhook secret.
 *
 * `quality.yml` and `release.yml` are reusable workflows the fleet calls at
 * `@main`, so a compromised upstream would execute inside every consumer's
 * quality gate on their next run.
 *
 * Pinning today does not stop the next `uses:` line, which is why the durable
 * artifact is this detector rather than the pins. A stale comment in a
 * consumer repository nearly caused two load-bearing references to be
 * unpinned; prose does not hold a boundary, an executable check does.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately NOT in scope
 *
 * **First-party references.** `uses: CodySwannGT/lisa/...@main` is a different
 * threat model — a stability question about an upstream we own and can read,
 * tracked separately in #3488 — and a check that reddens it is the wrong check
 * and will be turned off. First-party references never appear in this gate's
 * findings and are never named in its output. That exemption is a required
 * property with its own test, not an afterthought.
 *
 * **`actions/*` and `github/*`.** These are published by GitHub itself, the
 * same party that runs the job, so pinning them moves no trust boundary. The
 * decision is recorded here so it stays consistent, and the exemption is
 * narrow: it is an OWNER allowlist, not a substring match.
 *
 * **Fixture trees** (`tests/fixtures/`, `parity/fixtures/`). These are inputs
 * to other checks, never executed by GitHub Actions, and pinning them would
 * distort the shapes those checks exist to recognise. The count of skipped
 * fixture files is REPORTED in every run rather than silently dropped, so the
 * boundary is visible in the output instead of buried in this comment.
 *
 * **Consumer repositories already seeded from the `create-only` templates.**
 * A `create-only` file is written once and never overwritten, so correcting a
 * template changes what FUTURE repositories are seeded with and changes
 * nothing about any repository that already exists. This gate runs in this
 * repository only; it cannot and does not report seeded consumers as fixed.
 *
 * ## Why a bare SHA is also a finding
 *
 * `uses: <vendor>/<action>@<40-hex>` with no trailing comment is
 * immutable but unreadable: nobody can tell what is installed, so nobody
 * upgrades it, so it rots at whatever commit it was pinned at. The pin and the
 * human-readable version are one artifact, and the gate treats them that way.
 *
 * Determinism guarantees (so the unit test is reproducible and CI is stable):
 *   - zero third-party dependencies (Node built-ins only),
 *   - no network access,
 *   - no `Date` / `Math.random`,
 *   - the file list comes from `git ls-files`, so the gate sees exactly what a
 *     release would carry.
 *
 * ## `--warn`: how this arrives in a consumer without breaking it
 *
 * This file also ships to consumers through `all/copy-overwrite/scripts/`,
 * which — unlike `create-only` — reaches every repository that already exists,
 * on its next update. That reach is exactly why it must not arrive blocking.
 *
 * A consumer's seeded workflows carry mutable refs *today*: that is the defect
 * #3588 exists to migrate away. A detector that hard-failed on arrival would
 * redden the entire installed base at once, for a condition those repositories
 * did not introduce and could not have fixed yet, since the migration that
 * fixes it lands in the same update. That is not hypothetical — a guard added
 * to a workflow consumed at `@main` failed closed on a pre-existing consumer
 * misconfiguration and took four repositories' releases down for five hours;
 * the repair was to keep it loud and stop it blocking (#3755, #3757).
 *
 * So `--warn` reports every finding and exits 0, and the shipped consumer
 * script entry uses it. Tightening to blocking is a separate, deliberate
 * decision for once the installed base has had a chance to migrate — one flag
 * on one line — not something to "finish" while consumers are still mutable.
 *
 * `--warn` also softens the empty-scan usage error, because a consumer with no
 * workflow files is an ordinary shape rather than a broken invocation. A
 * misspelled flag stays a hard error in every mode: that one is the caller's.
 *
 * CLI:
 *   node scripts/check-third-party-action-pins.mjs [--root <dir>] [--json] [--warn]
 *
 * Exit codes (mirroring the sibling gates in this directory):
 *   0 — every third-party reference is a 40-hex SHA carrying a version comment;
 *       or `--warn` was passed and the findings are being reported, not enforced.
 *   1 — >=1 reference is mutable, or pinned without a version comment.
 *   2 — operational/usage error: unknown flag, a flag missing its value,
 *       `--root` absent or not a git repository, git unavailable, or zero
 *       workflow files discovered. Finding nothing to check is a broken
 *       invocation, not conformance — except under `--warn`, see above.
