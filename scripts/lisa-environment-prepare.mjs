/**
 * lisa-environment-prepare — the caller the `environment:*` facade never had.
 *
 * Lisa already defines the facade and ships gates that prove a project's reset
 * guard REFUSES. It shipped nothing that actually resets an environment before
 * a suite, so every consumer hand-wired its own: measured 2026-08-19, one
 * frontend resets after its browser suite via `if: always()`, the same repo's
 * native suite resets not at all, and a second repo's shape could not be
 * verified. A native suite had therefore been accumulating data nightly.
 *
 * This module owns three things and deliberately no more:
 *
 * 1. **Lifecycle completeness and sequencing.** Every preparation invokes
 *    reset and then reseed. They are not commutative: reseeding and then
 *    emptying leaves an empty environment that reports as prepared. A project
 *    that needs no fixture data still declares an explicit no-op reseed so the
 *    lifecycle remains observable and uniform; omitting the verb is not the
 *    same decision.
 * 2. **Failure semantics.** A verb the caller ASKED FOR and that the project
 *    does not declare is a failure, never a skip. This is the whole point. A
 *    suite that runs against an environment nobody reset, and reports green,
 *    is the defect the facade work existed to prevent, and it is exactly what
 *    a tolerant "the script wasn't there, carry on" would reintroduce.
 * 3. **Refusing production before invoking anything.**
 *
 * What it does NOT own is what the verbs do. Per the facade contract §3 the
 * verbs are an interface, not a mechanism; a project may implement them with a
 * local script today and a scoped Lambda tomorrow without this file changing.
 *
 * ## On the production refusal, and what it is worth
 *
 * The check here is a CALLER-SIDE refusal on the environment name it was
 * handed. It is not identity verification and must not be read as any: this
 * process has no connection to the target and no way to learn that a name
 * reading `dev` addresses a production database through a tunnel or a copied
 * env file. That gap is closed by layers this file cannot reach — the reset
 * capability not being deployed to production at all, an execution role that
 * cannot invoke it there, the implementation asserting its own resolved stage,
 * and the implementation asserting the database it actually connected to.
 *
 * So this refusal is the cheap outer layer of several, and its value is that
 * it is the one that fires before a single process starts. It is written
 * against the shipped `lisa-destructive-guard` classifier rather than a fresh
 * regex so that "what counts as production" has ONE definition in Lisa — the
 * guard already treats `prod`, `prd` and `live` as production and treats an
 * identity it cannot read exactly as it treats production.

 *
 * The deadline is deliberately NOT the shared default. The child here is the
 * PROJECT's own environment tooling — a database reset, a reseed — which
 * legitimately runs for minutes, so a default sized for a `git` call would make
 * this module's own timeout the ordinary outcome. It is a hang detector, not a

 * The killed-child verdict downstream is right — the caller reports "was killed

 * layered onto a failed reset produces fixture data on top of whatever the last
 * run left behind. Reaching it is what this has to get right.
 *
 * `boundedSpawnSync` reports a kill by THROWING, deliberately, so that a call
 * site which does nothing inherits fail-closed behaviour. This one did
 * something: it read `child.error` on the RETURNED result, which is the shape
 * plain `spawnSync` produces and the shape the helper exists to remove. That
 * branch was therefore unreachable for a kill, and the throw went past
 * `prepareEnvironment` entirely — so the deadline produced a stack trace rather
 * than the refusal the caller already knew how to print.
