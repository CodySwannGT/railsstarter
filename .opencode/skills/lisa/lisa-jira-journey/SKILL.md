# JIRA Validation Journey (TypeScript)

All Atlassian operations in this skill go through `lisa-atlassian-access`. Do not call MCP tools or `acli` directly. Note: the helper scripts (`scripts/parse-plan.py`, `scripts/jira-evidence/post-evidence.sh`) currently use direct API calls and are pending migration to route through `atlassian-access`.

Parse a JIRA ticket's Validation Journey, execute the verification steps using the appropriate tools for the change type, capture evidence at each typed `[EVIDENCE: <artifact-type>: <name>]` marker, and post to JIRA + GitHub PR.

## Arguments

`$ARGUMENTS`: `<TICKET_ID> [PR_NUMBER]`

- `TICKET_ID` (required): JIRA ticket key (e.g., `PROJ-123`)
- `PR_NUMBER` (optional): GitHub PR number to update description

## Prerequisites

- `JIRA_API_TOKEN` environment variable set
- `jira-cli` configured — `.lisa/jira-cli/.config.yml` (written by the
  `setup-jira-cli` SessionStart hook) or `~/.config/.jira/.config.yml`
- `gh` CLI authenticated
- Appropriate services running for the verification type (dev server, database, etc.)

## Workflow

### Step 1: Parse the Validation Journey

Run the parser script to extract the Validation Journey from the JIRA ticket description:

```bash
python3 .claude/skills/jira-journey/scripts/parse-plan.py <TICKET_ID>
```

The parser resolves Jira configuration from the checkout first: it searches
`$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.lisa/jira-cli/.config.yml`, then the current directory and
its parents, and uses `~/.config/.jira/.config.yml` when no checkout config
exists. Do not copy project settings into the home-level file just to make this
step work.

A checkout config is not automatically trusted. The first checkout candidate
that exists is decisive — that is `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` when it is set, which
outranks a config nearer the current directory, and only otherwise the nearest
one walking up from the current directory. Its server must match the operator's
trust root — `JIRA_SERVER` when set, otherwise the home config — and a mismatch
fails naming that file rather than quietly using the home config instead, so the
error points at the file that is actually wrong.

`server` must be a bare HTTPS origin: `https://host`, optionally with a port and
a single trailing slash. An explicit `:443` is accepted and canonicalized away,
so `https://host:443` and `https://host` are the same origin and either may be
configured. Userinfo (`https://user:token@…`), a query, a fragment, and any
other path are refused rather than trimmed away. So are a hostname this parser
cannot describe unambiguously — surrounding whitespace, control characters,
percent-encoded or non-ASCII hostnames, a trailing dot, and port 0.
The reason is that this value is both the trust key and the base every request
is built from; normalizing a richer URL down to its origin would approve one
value and then send the API token to a different one. Self-hosted context paths
and internationalized hostnames are out of scope and would need their own
base-path contract.

The script outputs JSON with: `ticket`, `prerequisites`, `steps`, `viewports`, `assertions`.

Note: `viewports` may be empty for TypeScript tickets — that is expected.

### Step 2: Satisfy Prerequisites

Before starting the journey, verify each prerequisite:

1. Check if required services are running
2. Verify database connectivity if needed
3. Ensure environment variables are set
4. Run any setup commands mentioned in prerequisites

### Step 3: Execute Steps and Capture Evidence

Execute each step sequentially. For each step, determine the verification approach based on the step text and change type:

- **API endpoints** → Run curl commands, capture HTTP response to `evidence/NN-name.txt`
- **Database changes** → Run psql/migration commands, capture schema output to `evidence/NN-name.txt`
- **Background jobs** → Trigger the job, check queue/state, capture logs to `evidence/NN-name.txt`
- **Library/utility changes** → Run tests, capture output to `evidence/NN-name.txt`
- **Security fixes** → Reproduce exploit attempt, verify fix, capture output to `evidence/NN-name.txt`

At each typed `[EVIDENCE: <artifact-type>: <name>]` marker, capture an artifact **of the declared type** — the type is the contract, not a suggestion:

- `screenshot` / `recording` → an actual image/video file from the driven UI (Playwright, simulator), never a text description of what was seen
- `http-transcript` → the exact request (curl command or client call) plus the full response
- `cli-output` → the command plus stdout/stderr and exit code
- `log-snippet` → the correlated log lines pulled from the running system
- `db-query-output` → the query plus returned rows
- `perf-trace` → the benchmark/frame-timing/profiler output with methodology (device profile, dataset size)
- `test-run-log` → reporter output naming the spec and showing it ran and passed
- `deploy-log` / `state-dump` → the deployment/health-check output or observed-state JSON

A prose claim ("the error state rendered gracefully") satisfies no marker. Legacy untyped markers: infer the type from the step's action, capture accordingly, and note the inference. Write each artifact to a numbered file:

Treat only exact `[EVIDENCE: ...]` markers (plus the legacy local `[SCREENSHOT: ...]` form) as capture instructions. Both the canonical `[EVIDENCE-REF: <work-item-ref> | <artifact-type>: <kebab-case-name>]` and the Lisa 2.223.0 legacy alias `[EVIDENCE-REF: <tracker-ref>: <artifact-type>: <kebab-case-name>]` point to another work item's artifact: preserve either as explanatory text, but do not capture it, assign it a sequence number, include it in duplicate-name checks, or count it as a local manifest entry. If a runtime-changing leaf has references but no local claiming marker, stop because S14 is unsatisfied.

#### Evidence Naming Convention

Evidence files are named: `{NN}-{evidence-name}.{ext}` — extension matches the declared artifact type (`.png`/`.webm` for screenshot/recording, `.txt` for transcripts/logs/output, `.json` for structured state)

- `NN`: zero-padded sequential number (01, 02, 03...)
- `evidence-name`: the `<name>` part of the typed marker in the JIRA step

Example:

```text
evidence/
  01-health-check.json
  02-schema-after-migration.txt
  03-rate-limit-response.txt
  comment.txt
  comment.md
```

### Step 4: Generate Evidence Templates

After capturing all evidence, run the template generator:

```bash
python3 .claude/skills/jira-journey/scripts/generate-templates.py \
  <TICKET_ID> \
  <PR_NUMBER> \
  <BRANCH_NAME> \
  ./evidence
```

This generates `evidence/comment.txt` (JIRA wiki markup) and `evidence/comment.md` (GitHub markdown) with evidence formatted as code blocks.

### Step 5: Post Evidence

Use the jira-evidence skill to post everything:

```bash
bash .claude/skills/jira-evidence/scripts/post-evidence.sh <TICKET_ID> ./evidence <PR_NUMBER>
```

### Step 6: Verify

Confirm evidence is posted to both the JIRA ticket and GitHub PR.

## Verification Patterns Reference

The agent should use patterns from the project's `verfication.md` when executing steps:

| Change Type | Verification Method | Evidence Format |
|---|---|---|
| API endpoint | `curl -s localhost:PORT/endpoint` | JSON response |
| Database migration | `psql -c "\d table"` or migration output | Schema text |
| Background job | Trigger + check state | Log output |
| Library/utility | `bun run test -- path/to/test` | Test output |
| Security fix | Reproduce + verify fix | Request/response |
| Auth/authz | Multi-role verification | Status codes per role |

## Troubleshooting

### Evidence file is empty

Ensure the command succeeded and produced output. Use `2>&1` to capture both stdout and stderr.

### Parser returns no steps

The ticket may not have a Validation Journey section. Use `/jira-add-journey <TICKET_ID>` to add one.
