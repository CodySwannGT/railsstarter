# Queue Status: $ARGUMENTS

`/lisa:queue-status` is the operator-facing inspection surface for Lisa's live backlog state. It answers, for the **current repo only**, what Lisa's configured PRD queue and build queue currently look like, whether the queues appear healthy or stuck, and which items are most actionable next.

This command is **read-only** in v1. It does not create, claim, relabel, repair, transition, comment on, or otherwise mutate queue items. It complements `/lisa:intake`, `/lisa:repair-intake`, `/lisa:verify-prd`, `/lisa:automation-status`, and the underlying vendor trackers; it does not replace them.

## Confirmation policy

Do **not** ask for confirmation once invoked. This skill inspects queue state and reports what it finds. There are no write-side effects in the v1 surface.

## Scope

Inspect only the Lisa queues for the current project:

- the configured PRD source queue
- the configured build tracker queue

Resolve queue source, tracker, lifecycle roles, and queue arguments from the **same contract** Lisa already uses for `/lisa:intake` and `/lisa:repair-intake`. Do **not** invent a second source of truth for queue detection, lifecycle naming, or stack support.

Support a repo-scoped queue selector when requested:

- default: inspect both queues
- `queue=prd`: inspect only the PRD queue
- `queue=build`: inspect only the build queue

## Operator usage

Typical entrypoints:

```text
/lisa:queue-status
/lisa:queue-status queue=prd
/lisa:queue-status queue=build
```

Use this command when an operator needs to answer one of these questions for the current repo:

- "Is this queue truly idle, or is it misconfigured?"
- "Which item is the most actionable next?"
- "Should I run `/lisa:intake`, `/lisa:repair-intake`, `/lisa:automation-status`, or `/lisa:verify-prd` next?"

Keep the report terminal-first and immediately actionable: observable queue facts first, then the smallest useful next command.

## What to report

Render the report in **grouped sections** so operators can scan it top-down without reading raw tracker dumps:

1. An optional overall queue-health summary when inspecting both queues.
2. One PRD queue section when the PRD queue is in scope.
3. One build queue section when the build queue is in scope.

For each inspected queue, report:

1. The queue source or tracker Lisa resolved.
2. For GitHub, both `Identity repo: <owner/repo>` and `Queue repo: <owner/repo>`, even when equal.
3. Lifecycle counts using the repo's configured role names. GitHub umbrella-queue build counts
   must be scoped to `repo:<currentRepo>` from the repo-scoping ladder; the queue repo is never
   current-repo identity.
4. Whether the queue appears `IDLE`, `HEALTHY`, `ATTENTION_NEEDED`, or `MISCONFIGURED`.
5. Whether the lifecycle namespace appears adopted versus absent.
6. The oldest or most actionable blocked, in-review, claimed, shipped, or similar stuck items Lisa can surface without mutating work.
7. A concise remediation hint when attention is needed.

The report should stay terminal-first and immediately actionable: observable queue facts first, then the smallest useful next step.

## Delivery effort

Alongside queue counts, run the read-only `lisa effectiveness report`. Show observed
human interventions per accepted outcome, its numerator/denominator, and evidence
sources. State that this covers locally observed outcomes; absent reports or null
attention mean **unknown**, not zero. If queue-wide coverage has not been verified,
do not imply the ratio describes the whole queue. Show the separate run clocks and
committed recurring-failure counts when present. Do not create reports, change
tracker state, or use PR/token counts as outcome-value proxies from this skill.

## Pull request arming (#3903)

Alongside the two work queues, report the **arming state of the repo's open pull requests**. A PR whose `autoMergeRequest` is `null` is fully green and permanently unmergeable: every check passes, `mergeStateStatus` is green, nothing complains, and it waits forever. Green-and-unarmed and green-and-waiting read identically on every other surface, so this is the one place that asks the question.

Run the sweep rather than eyeballing the list — an LLM reading PR pages one at a time is exactly the shell-loop-by-prose failure #3512 records:

```bash
gh pr list --state open --limit 200 \
  --json number,title,url,isDraft,labels,body,autoMergeRequest \
  | node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/pr-arming-sweep.mjs"
```

Report the verdict verbatim, and never translate it into an absence:

- `MEASURED_CLEAN` — a **positive assertion**: N open PRs were read and every one is armed or deliberately unarmed. Say the count. "Nothing to report" is not the same sentence and must not be substituted for it.
- `UNARMED_PRS_FOUND` — list each PR. The next step is `gh pr merge <n> --auto --merge` **followed by reading the state back** (`gh pr view <n> --json autoMergeRequest`); arming can be silently dropped after the fact, so an arm that was not read back is not a fact.
- `NOT_MEASURED` — the arming state was **not read** for at least one PR (usually a `--json` selection missing `autoMergeRequest`). This is an unanswered question, not a clean queue. Fix the query and re-run; do **not** report the queue as healthy.

Arming state feeds no queue verdict and gates nothing — this stays a report, per #3903's Out of Scope. Never arm a PR from this skill; `/lisa:queue-status` is read-only.

A PR deliberately left for a human (`lisa-drive-pr-to-merge`'s `auto_merge=false` mode) declares itself with the `lisa:auto-merge-off` label or a `[lisa-auto-merge-off] reason=<text>` body marker. Drafts are excluded — GitHub will not arm a draft.

**Held PRs are suppressed from the findings, never from the report.** Always show the `Held (declared, not merging): N` block and the numbers under it, including when the verdict is `MEASURED_CLEAN`. This is a one-label remedy for a red sweep and it will look like housekeeping to whoever applies it — "4 armed, 0 unarmed" and "4 armed, 0 unarmed, 9 held" describe very different queues, and only the second lets an operator notice the label spreading. Flag it when holds outnumber armed PRs, or when several read `no reason declared`.

## Highlight semantics

Each queue section may include one or more highlighted items. A highlight is not a raw dump of every issue in that role; it is the single oldest or otherwise most actionable item Lisa can justify surfacing without mutating work.

Interpret highlights by role:

- `ready`: work is waiting to be claimed. The usual next step is `/lisa:intake <queue>`.
- `blocked`: work is stuck behind an explicit blocker or failed pre-flight. The usual next step is `/lisa:repair-intake <queue>` after validating the blocker context.
- `claimed` or in-review/review states: work is in motion but may be aging. The usual next step is to inspect the active implementation or review path before escalating to `/lisa:repair-intake <queue>`.
- `shipped`: PRD work looks ready for initiative-level acceptance. The usual next step is `/lisa:verify-prd <prd-ref>`.

If both queues look unexpectedly quiet or stale, mention `/lisa:automation-status` as the scheduler-health follow-up before implying the queues themselves are empty or broken.

## Output shape

Use a stable terminal-friendly shape:

1. `Overall verdict` line when both queues are shown.
2. `PRD queue` heading with resolved source, verdict, lifecycle counts, actionable highlights, and remediation.
3. `Build queue` heading with resolved tracker, verdict, lifecycle counts, actionable highlights, and remediation.

Queue sections should stay visually grouped. Do not interleave PRD and build facts item-by-item.

## Runtime and vendor expectations

- Reuse the same config-resolution defaults and queue-routing rules that `intake` and `repair-intake` use.
- For GitHub, resolve an explicit repo/URL first, then merged `github.queueRepo`, then
  `github.org/github.repo`; accept a short queueRepo by normalizing it to `github.org`.
- Pass the contract's `currentRepo` into `readGithubBuildQueueSnapshot`; lifecycle counts include
  only `repo:<current>` work. Report its `unscopedCount` / `unscopedCandidates` separately because
  intake still needs to determine and stamp unlabeled work; exclude sibling-only issues.
- Work from the current repo's `.lisa.config.json` instead of hardcoding one vendor's lifecycle names.
- Support the vendor families already served by Lisa intake: GitHub, Linear, JIRA, Notion, and Confluence.
- If a queue cannot be resolved or its lifecycle namespace has not been adopted, report that explicitly as `MISCONFIGURED` rather than pretending the queue is empty.

## Verdicts and remediation

- `IDLE`: the queue resolved successfully and no actionable ready or stuck work is present.
- `HEALTHY`: the queue resolved successfully and the current backlog/state appears normal.
- `ATTENTION_NEEDED`: the queue resolved, but blocked, stalled, or accumulating work needs operator follow-up.
- `MISCONFIGURED`: Lisa could not resolve the queue, could not find the expected lifecycle namespace, or detected another setup/adoption problem.

When both queues are in scope, derive the **overall verdict** from the queue sections:

- `MISCONFIGURED` if any inspected queue is misconfigured.
- Otherwise `ATTENTION_NEEDED` if any inspected queue needs operator follow-up.
- Otherwise `HEALTHY` if any inspected queue has normal actionable work in motion.
- Otherwise `IDLE`.

Status-specific remediation guidance:

- `IDLE`: explain that the queue is currently quiet and no immediate operator action is required.
- `HEALTHY`: point operators to `/lisa:intake` or `/lisa:repair-intake` when they want Lisa to act on the reported state.
- `ATTENTION_NEEDED`: identify the most actionable blocked or stalled items and suggest the next Lisa or tracker-native command to investigate.
- `MISCONFIGURED`: show which queue contract is missing or unresolved and recommend fixing `.lisa.config.json`, adopting the lifecycle namespace, or rerunning the relevant setup flow.

Command handoff expectations:

- Prefer `/lisa:intake <queue>` when the actionable highlight is `ready` work.
- Prefer `/lisa:repair-intake <queue>` when the actionable highlight is blocked, stalled, or suspiciously old claimed/review work.
- Prefer `/lisa:verify-prd <prd-ref>` when the PRD side surfaces shipped work that appears ready for initiative-level verification.
- Prefer `/lisa:automation-status` when queue output suggests scheduler drift, stale unattended execution, or a mismatch between expected and observed queue activity.

## Rules

- Stay **read-only**. Never create, update, claim, relabel, repair, transition, or comment on queue items from this skill.
- Keep the report repo-scoped to the current project instead of aggregating unrelated repos or teams.
- Distinguish truly idle queues from lifecycle-namespace absence or unresolved config.
- Reuse `intake` and `repair-intake` contract semantics so queue health reporting does not drift from execution behavior.
- Keep observable queue facts separate from remediation guidance so operators can tell the current state from the recommended next step.
