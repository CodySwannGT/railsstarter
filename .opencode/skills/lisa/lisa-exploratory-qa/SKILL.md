description: First-time-user exploratory QA pass for ANY product type (DOM web app, HTTP/API backend, canvas game, CLI/library, IaC/CDK) that FEEDS THE LIFECYCLE. Use when asked to experience a product the way a brand-new end user would — driving its real consumer-facing interface via the `use-the-product` core (which detects the product type, resolves the per-environment mutation policy from .lisa.config.json so production data is never mutated by accident, and explores through the project's personas when it defines them) to find anything confusing, broken, or hard to use. Static route scans, HTTP fetches, screenshots alone, or console/network checks alone are not sufficient evidence. Instead of writing a report file, it files every finding as a tracked work item via lisa-tracker-write. A `ready` parameter controls whether those tickets are created build-ready (auto-picked-up by lisa-intake) or left in the backlog for human triage (default). For gaps in the automated test suite, use e2e-coverage-gaps instead.

# Exploratory QA

## Overview

Experience the product the way a **brand-new end user** would: drive its real consumer-facing interface and actually try to use it, then surface anything **confusing, broken, or hard to understand**. This is a usability/experience pass, **not** a test-coverage audit (for that, use `e2e-coverage-gaps`). Every finding is filed as a tracked work item so it enters the Lisa lifecycle — no static report file.

**How you drive the product is owned by the `use-the-product` core skill.** Invoke it first: it detects the product type (web / API / game / CLI / IaC), resolves the target environment and its **mutation policy** (so you never mutate production without an explicit, justified opt-in), and discovers the project's **personas** so you can explore as each one. This skill supplies the **QA lens** — what to look for and how to file it.

## Parameters

- **`target-url | env`** (first positional) — what to explore (passed through to `use-the-product`).
- **`ready=true|false`** — the build-ready state for the tickets this pass creates.
  - `ready=true` → created build-ready, so `lisa-intake` / the build-intake scanner auto-picks them up.
  - `ready=false` (**default**) → created in the backlog for a human to review and promote.

## 1. Set up

- **Invoke `use-the-product`** to detect the product type, resolve the environment + mutation policy, and discover personas/subagents. Everything about *how* to drive the product, *where*, and *how much you may mutate* comes from there — do not re-derive it.
- **Confirm the tracker is configured.** Findings are filed as tickets, so read `tracker` from `.lisa.config.json` (local overrides global). If unset, stop and report that the tracker must be configured (`/lisa:setup:jira` / `:github` / `:linear`) before exploratory QA can file findings — do not silently fall back to a report file.
- Read the `ready` flag (default `false`).

## 2. Arrive cold and use it like a human

- Start with **no prior knowledge** — do not pre-read the codebase to learn the intended flows; discover them the way a user would. Form a first impression: is it obvious what this product is, what to do first, and where to go next?
- Then actually attempt real tasks through the interface (per `use-the-product`'s per-type playbook), exercising representative controls/endpoints/commands — a first-time user explores, makes mistakes, and tries the obvious thing.

## 3. The QA lens — what to look for

Cover at least these dimensions unless the user narrows scope. Most are universal; the web-specific ones are marked and have per-type equivalents in §4.

- **Comprehension & labeling:** user-facing copy must read like something a normal first-time user understands. Flag machine-style/developer labels (raw IDs, enum keys, `snake_case`, `null`/`undefined`, untranslated i18n keys), admin/database terms ("metadata", "rows", "record", "entity"), unexplained jargon, unclear button/menu names, and meaningless icons. If a label would make a non-technical user ask "what does that mean?", file a clarity ticket.
- **Data usefulness & context:** facts, metrics, and tables must help a person understand the surface, not just prove extraction happened. If a user can't tell what a number or field refers to without rereading the raw source, file a ticket to add context (excerpts, labels, grouping, provenance) or hide it.
- **Data volume & trust:** compare visible data to what the surface promises. A rich view with only a few items can read as broken/filtered/still-loading. File a finding when sparse data isn't explained (result counts, active filters, reset affordances, coverage status, sample labeling).
- **Controls & mental model:** controls must match what they do (sort ≠ filter; search ≠ facet; finite domains want selects/typeaheads, not blank text inputs). Flag controls that make users guess spelling/casing, hide the option universe, or use the wrong component.
- **Flow completeness & expected counterparts:** a screen that gates access or shows one side of a standard paired flow must offer the other side, or a clear path to it. A new user must never hit a dead end with no next step. Flag: **sign-in with no sign-up** (or vice-versa), **no account recovery** ("Forgot password?", resend verification), **no exit from a state** (no sign-out; a modal/wizard with no back/close/cancel), **one-way actions** (create with no edit/delete where both are expected), **unreachable entry points** (a feature only reachable by guessing a URL; an empty state with no primary action). When the missing counterpart makes a core task impossible for a class of users, file a `Bug`; otherwise a usability `Improvement`.
- **Action preconditions & incomplete end-states:** an action that needs multiple inputs or a prerequisite (compare, merge, bulk-edit) should guide the user to satisfy it — disable/explain until met, collect inputs first, or give the destination an in-place control. Actually trigger these and watch where they land; flag when a primary action fires under-satisfied and strands the user, lands on an empty/partial end-state with no next step, or is offered where it cannot succeed. Left unable to finish → `Bug`; works but confusing → `Improvement`.
- **Navigation clarity:** is it obvious how to get somewhere and back? Flag dead ends, hidden entry points, surprising redirects, broken links, no clear "home", and duplicated nav that competes for space without page-specific value.
- **Behavior correctness:** does the obvious action do what a user expects? Confusing errors, silent failures, disabled controls with no explanation, state that doesn't persist.
- **Affordance clarity:** can the user tell what is clickable, required, in-progress, or complete?
- **Load & responsiveness:** long/unclear loads, blank or skeleton-only shells, spinners with no progress. Flag surfaces that report "loaded" but where meaningful content arrives much later. Capture user-perceived timings (shell visible, first meaningful content, stable content); if the delay is noticeable, file it even when the eventual content is correct.
- **Visual/layout quality (DOM web):** cut-off/truncated text, overlap, cramped density, offscreen controls, accidental horizontal scroll. **Do not judge by eyeballing a screenshot alone** — confirm with the layout-integrity sweep in §4.
- **Consistency / standard UX:** components, spacing, terminology, and interaction patterns should be consistent and follow common conventions. Flag anything non-standard or screen-to-screen drift.

## 4. Type-specific depth

- **DOM web app — breakpoints & layout integrity.** Sweep a range of widths, including the *in-between* ones where clipping appears (e.g. 360, 390, 414, 600, 768, 834, 1024, 1280, 1440 plus ~900–1180 steps), and re-walk key paths at each. At every width, in addition to looking, take DOM measurements and treat as findings: **container overflow** (`documentElement.scrollWidth > clientWidth`); **clipped/offscreen controls** (a control's `getBoundingClientRect()` falling outside the viewport or an `overflow:hidden|clip|auto|scroll` ancestor — e.g. a submit button cut off by its filter card); **truncated meaningful text** (`scrollWidth > clientWidth` / ellipsis on text that carries meaning); **colliding controls** (label overlapping an adjacent control with no gap). A primary/interactive control that is clipped, offscreen, or unreachable is a **`Bug`**, not an Improvement.
- **HTTP / API backend.** Judge the *contract as a consumer experiences it*: unclear/inconsistent status codes, error responses with no actionable message, payloads exposing internal shapes (raw enums, DB column names), missing pagination/among-counts, endpoints that 500 on obvious edge inputs. A broken/incorrect response is a `Bug`; a confusing-but-working contract is an `Improvement`.
- **Canvas game.** Judge readability at gameplay scale, input responsiveness/latency, game-feel, unclear objectives, and silent state changes — not DOM breakpoints. A soft-lock or lost progress is a `Bug`; unclear-but-playable friction is an `Improvement`.
- **CLI / library.** Judge help/output clarity, error messages, discoverability of commands, and surprising side effects. A wrong result / crash is a `Bug`; confusing UX is an `Improvement`.
- **IaC / CDK (read-only).** From `cdk synth`/`diff`: over-broad IAM, missing/opaque stack outputs, resources that don't serve their stated purpose, drift. A security-relevant misconfiguration is a `Bug`; unclear-but-correct infra is an `Improvement`.

## 5. Mutation

Whether you may create/edit/delete — and as which account — is set by the `use-the-product` mutation policy (`read-only` vs `full`, `identity`, production rules). Follow its **Mutation Discipline** when the policy is `full` (prefixed test data, identify + verify cleanup, record residue). Never mutate an env the policy marks `read-only` or `forbidden`; if a finding can only be confirmed by a forbidden mutation, file it as observed-and-blocked rather than escalating.

## 6. File findings as tracked work

No report file. Every finding becomes a **leaf work item** via `lisa-tracker-write` (the vendor-neutral writer — it dispatches to the configured tracker and runs the validation gate; never call a vendor `*-write-*` skill directly):

| Finding | `issue_type` | `build_ready` |
|---|---|---|
| User-visible **bug** (broken behavior) | `Bug` | the `ready` flag (default `false`) |
| **Usability / UX / clarity issue** | `Improvement` | the `ready` flag (default `false`) |

Each finding is a flat leaf, so `build_ready` applies directly — pass it explicitly on every create. Each ticket MUST be a complete spec (the validator rejects thin tickets): a **three-audience description**; for a **bug**, exact reproduction steps, observed-vs-expected, the env / account / interface it occurred at, and evidence; for a **usability issue**, the observed friction, who it affects, **where**, and the proposed improvement; and **Gherkin acceptance criteria** for the fixed behavior.

### Idempotency — don't spam duplicates

Re-running a pass must not refile the same finding. Before creating a ticket, search the tracker for an **open** ticket carrying a stable marker `[lisa-exploratory-qa] <finding-key>` in its body (the `<finding-key>` is a stable slug of surface + symptom, e.g. `settings-modal/horizontal-overflow@tablet`). If one exists, reference/update it instead; only create when none exists. **Match by the marker, never by title.** A *closed* prior ticket does not suppress a new one — a recurrence after a fix is a genuine regression.

## Output

No report file. Emit a concise in-session summary:

- **Scope:** product type, target env + mutation level, persona(s) explored as, tool, build/version if visible, date.
- **First impression:** could a new user tell what the product is and what to do first?
- **Findings filed**, bucketed by type — each with its **created or referenced ticket ref** and **build-ready state**.
- **Observed but not filed:** anything noticed but intentionally not ticketed (including forbidden-mutation blocks), with why.

## Quality bar

- Explore as a true first-time user — judge clarity, not whether you (who can read the code) can figure it out.
- Every ticket must stand alone for an implementer who was not in the session.
- Do not claim cleanup succeeded unless verified.
- File per the `ready` flag (default: backlog for human triage).
- Route automated-coverage gaps to `e2e-coverage-gaps`; preserve unrelated repo changes.
