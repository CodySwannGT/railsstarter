 * exists. A value present in both the provider and a local copy is **not a
 * duplicate** — it is two live credentials, one of which is untracked. Both
 * authenticate, so the difference is invisible from either side, and "tidying
 * up the duplicate" deletes a working credential that no record accounts for.
 * That is not hypothetical; it is what prompted the single-store rule.
 *
 * Every check reports without printing a value. Where two copies must be
 * compared, they are compared by digest.

 * Usage:
