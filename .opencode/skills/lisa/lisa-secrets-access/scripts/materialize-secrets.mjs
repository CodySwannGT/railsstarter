 * for the exact text it was about to write, so the first rename made it
 * conclude there was no block here and append a second one.
 *
 * That failure is additive and silent, and this module is the worst place in

 * can end up running under credentials from a block Lisa believes it no longer
 * manages. That is credential selection going wrong with no review step.
 *
 * Everywhere else in the codebase the mitigation is "widen the recogniser and
 * accept the old shape until an apply normalises the file". There is no such
 * operation here: the old population never drains and cannot be counted, so
 * the recogniser must accept every past version permanently.
