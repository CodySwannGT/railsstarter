 * disk. This is normally forbidden, because a value on disk is a copy that can
 * drift and leak. It is *required* on surfaces whose bootstrap runs before the
 * consuming process exists and which therefore have no other channel; a remote
 * agent container prepares itself during setup, long before any task starts.
 *
 * `materializeAt` — *when* the write happens, for surfaces that do one. The two
 * remote surfaces share the capability but not the timing, and a reader adding a
 * third should not assume otherwise. `codex-cloud` re-runs its setup script when
 * a container resumes, so materializing during setup picks up a rotated value.
 * `claude-web` *skips* its setup script whenever a filesystem cache exists, so
 * materializing there would strand a rotated value until the cache expired —
 * it materializes from a session-start hook instead, which runs every session.
 *
 * Stated as a capability rather than inferred from the surface name, so the
 * setup runner selects its phases from the table instead of branching on which
 * vendor it happens to be talking to.
