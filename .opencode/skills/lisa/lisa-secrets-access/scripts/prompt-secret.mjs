 *
 * - **A command-line argument** is visible in `ps` to every process on the
 *   machine for as long as the call runs, and a shell records it in history.
 * - **The clipboard** is worse than it looks. Raycast, Alfred, Maccy and every
 *   other clipboard manager persist history in plaintext, searchable, long
 *   after the paste — so a bootstrap routed through it outlives the operation
 *   in a database nobody thinks about. Reading it silently also takes whatever
 *   happens to be there, which is the wrong thing whenever the operator copied
 *   something else in between.
 * - **Echoed input** puts it in the terminal scrollback, which is frequently
 *   logged.
 *
 * So: read from the tty with echo off, and never touch anything else.
