/**
 * Turn the AWS bootstrap bundle into environment variables the AWS SDKs obey.
 *
 * `LISA_AWS_BOOTSTRAP_JSON` carries the agent's AWS identity as one JSON blob.
 * Materializing it verbatim is not enough, because nothing reads that name:
 * every AWS SDK and the CLI look for `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and
 * `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, or for a profile.
 *
 * Writing profiles alone is also not enough, and that is the failure this
 * module exists for. A Claude cloud container ships its own
 * `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` in the ambient environment, and
 * **environment variables outrank profile files in the credential chain**. So a
 * session with correctly written `~/.aws/credentials` still failed:
 *
 *     aws sts get-caller-identity
 *     InvalidClientTokenId: The security token included in the request is invalid.
 *
 * Deriving the pair into the materialized env file fixes it, because that file
 * is sourced into the session and the last export wins. Exporting over a
 * variable this project did not set is a real intrusion, so it is deliberate,
 * narrow, and never silent:
 *
 *   - only when the bundle actually parses and carries both halves
 *   - never over a value the secret store itself supplies under those names,
 *     which is a project stating an explicit intent
 *   - recorded in the notes file, so the override is discoverable by the same
 *     read-the-note path as any other credential

 * `source_profile = lisa-bootstrap` would point at a section that no longer
 * exists, and every call through it would fail to resolve.
 *
 * So the owned names are EMITTED as canonical and these bare names are kept
 * RESOLVING beside them, both generated from one bundle in one pass. This
 * constant is never used to decide what canonical output looks like, and it is
 * not used to attribute a block either — ownership is read from the `owner=`
 * marker tag, and a pre-ownership block is attributed by the accounts in its
 * role ARNs. Its only job is the resolve path.

 * `<namespace>-<stage>`; `LISA_SECRETS_NO_LEGACY_PROFILES=1` lets one opt out
