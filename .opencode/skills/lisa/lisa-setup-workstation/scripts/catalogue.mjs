/**
 * What a workstation can hold, and how each piece is installed.
 *
 * This is the layer beneath `remoteEnv.tools`: it describes a MACHINE, not a
 * project, so nothing here is read from a checkout and no repository needs to
 * exist. The project-scoped manifest still owns project-scoped tools.
 *
 * ## Install method is a per-tool property, not a global policy
 *
 * The obvious design — put every binary in `~/.local/bin` so one code path
 * serves a laptop and a container alike — is wrong, and the agents show why:
 *
 *     claude       -> ~/.local/share/claude/versions/2.1.221
 *     cursor-agent -> ~/.local/share/cursor-agent/versions/2026.07.16-899851b
 *     codex        -> ~/.codex/packages/standalone/current/bin/codex
 *
 * Each vendor manages its own version directory and `~/.local/bin` holds only a
 * SYMLINK. Writing a raw binary there breaks the vendor's self-updater, which
 * expects to swap a link target and would instead find a real file in its way.
 *
 * So each entry declares its own method, and the honest cost is recorded with
 * it: a `vendor-script` entry is NOT pinned and NOT checksummed. That is a real
 * weakening of the guarantee `assertPinned` exists to provide, so the kind is
 * visible in the catalogue and in the report rather than blended in with
 * checksummed entries. A reader can see which tools are trusted to a vendor.
 * @module catalogue
