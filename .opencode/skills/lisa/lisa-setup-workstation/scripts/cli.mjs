/**
 * Command-line entry for the workstation bootstrap.
 *
 * Kept separate from `workstation.mjs` so the planning logic stays importable
 * and testable without a process boundary — a test should be able to ask "what
 * would this do" without any risk of it doing it.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   cli.mjs                                report present vs missing
 *   cli.mjs --install                      provision what is missing
 *   cli.mjs --install --agents=claude,codex   only these agents
 *   cli.mjs --install --tools=aws,sonar    only these OPTIONAL tools; required
 *                                          ones are always kept, and an empty
 *                                          value selects the whole catalogue
 *   cli.mjs --provider=bitwarden           credential manager (asked if a TTY)
 *   cli.mjs --json                         machine-readable plan
 *   cli.mjs --print-dockerfile             an image that runs this same script
 * @module cli
