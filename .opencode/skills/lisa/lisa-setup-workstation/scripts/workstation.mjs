/**
 * Prepare a machine — or a throwaway container — to run coding agents.
 *
 * This is the layer beneath `lisa-setup-local-env`, which reads a project's
 * `remoteEnv.tools` and therefore needs a checkout to exist first. That left
 * the machine most likely to be missing a tool — a fresh laptop, or an empty
 * container — with nothing to ask.
 *
 * Nothing here reads a repository. The composition is:
 *
 *     workstation  ->  git clone  ->  lisa-detect-tooling  ->  lisa-setup-local-env
 *
 * ## Ephemerality is not a mode
 *
 * There is no Docker branch. A container gets a throwaway `$HOME` and dies with
 * it; a laptop keeps its own. Same code path, so the rarely-run one cannot rot
 * — the failure mode a second install path always eventually has.
 *
 * ## Already-installed wins, however it got there
 *
 * A tool present by ANY means is reported and left alone. That dissolves the
 * "Homebrew or ~/.local/bin" question: we never contend for ownership of a tool
 * someone else's package manager installed, and never shadow it with an earlier
 * PATH entry that would silently win over their upgrades.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   workstation.mjs                     report what is present and missing
 *   workstation.mjs --install           install everything missing
 *   workstation.mjs --install --agents=claude,codex   only these agents
 *   workstation.mjs --json              machine-readable plan
 *   workstation.mjs --print-dockerfile  an image that runs this same script
 * @module workstation
