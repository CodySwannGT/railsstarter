# Sentry SDK Setup

Detect a project's framework and runtime, then install and configure the correct
Sentry SDK with sensible, production-ready defaults: client initialization, DSN
via environment variable, error capture, performance/tracing, and source map
upload so stack traces are readable.

## Consolidation note

Upstream `sentry@claude-plugins-official` 1.0.0 shipped **~30 separate per-SDK
setup skills**; this single Lisa-native skill consolidated all of them. As of
upstream **1.2.0** Sentry itself consolidated the suite into one
`sentry-instrument` playbook, so the shapes now match — but this skill remains a
from-scratch reimplementation against Lisa conventions, **not** a translation of
the upstream skill. Pinned to `sentry@claude-plugins-official@1.4.0` via
`synced-from` so the parity drift detector tracks it as one unit.

### Reviewed at 1.4.0 — the progress-reporting protocol is deliberately declined

Read the pin as **reviewed against 1.4.0**, not as *tracks 1.4.0*. The
`synced-from` scalar cannot say which it means, so this section says it.

Upstream 1.4.0's substantive addition is an onboarding progress protocol: the
setup skill scans the user's first prompt for an opaque token and, from then on,
reports staged setup progress to a third-party web application over the vendor's
MCP — with an explicit instruction to make those calls with no narration,
announcement, or summary of their reply or failure, and never to mention the
token unless the user asks about it directly.

**Lisa does not reimplement it, at 1.4.0 or on a later bump.** Data about the
user's session leaving their environment as a silent side effect of running a
skill is not a behavior Lisa adopts by default, and a skill that is told to
withhold a tool call from the person running it is the specific part being
refused. This is a statement about what a Lisa-native skill may do unobserved,
not a judgment on the upstream product — an operator who wants that reporting
can run the upstream plugin directly, where the behavior is the vendor's to
explain.

The rest of the 1.3.2 → 1.4.0 delta is two per-integration Beta → Stable label
edits in upstream's own reference docs. This skill carries no per-integration
status table, so there is nothing here to restate.

## Step 0 — Scope the install

Decide what you are actually doing before touching code; default to the
smallest scope (adapted from upstream 1.2.0's scope gate):

- **First error** — no Sentry yet: install the SDK, initialize it for **error
  capture plus tracing** — noting that tracing is **opt-in** in every Sentry
  SDK: it only activates when you set `tracesSampleRate`/`tracesSampler` (and,
  in browsers, add the tracing integration, e.g.
  `browserTracingIntegration()`), exactly as the Step 3 snippets do — then
  verify a real captured event and stop. Do not wire up further signals
  unasked.
- **Add a signal** — Sentry already installed and the user wants one more signal
  (logging, profiling, session replay, metrics, cron check-ins, AI/LLM
  monitoring): skip install/provisioning and configure just that signal per the
  SDK's docs.
- **Full setup** — the user asked for "proper" defaults: do first-error, then
  propose releases + source maps + the signals that fit the app, and add what
  they accept.

**Never over-instrument.** Wiring up every signal upfront produces noise,
quota burn, and config the team doesn't understand.

## Step 1 — Detect framework & runtime

Inspect the project before choosing an SDK. Read `package.json`
(dependencies/scripts), config files, and lockfiles:

- `next` dependency or `next.config.*` → **Next.js**
- `@nestjs/core` → **NestJS**
- `react-native` / `expo` → **React Native / Expo**
- `react` + a bundler (vite/webpack) without Next → **React (browser)**
- `express` / `fastify` / `koa` and a Node entrypoint → **Node server**
- `vue` / `@angular/core` / `svelte` → that browser framework
- `pyproject.toml` / `requirements.txt`; `django`/`flask`/`fastapi` →
  **Python** (and which web framework)
- A plain Node library/CLI → **Node**

If the runtime is genuinely ambiguous, ask which app to instrument rather than
guessing. Respect the project's package manager (bun/npm/pnpm/yarn — match the
lockfile) and module system (ESM vs CJS).

## Step 2 — Install the package

Use the project's package manager. Examples (swap `bun add` for your manager):

| Framework | Package |
| --- | --- |
| React (browser) | `@sentry/react` |
| Next.js | `@sentry/nextjs` |
| Node / Express / Fastify | `@sentry/node` (+ `@sentry/profiling-node` for profiling) |
| NestJS | `@sentry/nestjs` (+ `@sentry/node`) |
| React Native / Expo | `@sentry/react-native` |
| Vue | `@sentry/vue` |
| Angular | `@sentry/angular` |
| Svelte / SvelteKit | `@sentry/svelte` / `@sentry/sveltekit` |
| Python (generic) | `sentry-sdk` |
| Django | `sentry-sdk[django]` |
| Flask | `sentry-sdk[flask]` |
| FastAPI | `sentry-sdk[fastapi]` |

For Next.js, prefer the official wizard when available — it scaffolds the config
files and source-map upload for you:

```bash
npx @sentry/wizard@latest -i nextjs
```

## Step 3 — Initialize the client

Initialize **as early as possible** in the app's lifecycle, before other code
runs. Always read the DSN from the environment (see Step 4) — never hard-code it.

**React (browser)** — `src/instrument.ts`, imported first in the entrypoint:

```ts
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: import.meta.env.VITE_SENTRY_DSN,
  environment: import.meta.env.MODE,
  integrations: [Sentry.browserTracingIntegration()],
  tracesSampleRate: 0.1, // tune per traffic; 1.0 in dev
});
```

**Node / Express** — `instrument.ts`, required at the very top of the entrypoint
(`import "./instrument";` must be the first import):

```ts
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/node";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: process.env.SENTRY_DSN,
  environment: process.env.NODE_ENV,
  tracesSampleRate: 0.1,
});
```

Then, after routes are defined: `Sentry.setupExpressErrorHandler(app);`

**NestJS** — import `./instrument` first in `main.ts`, then add Sentry's module:

```ts
// main.ts — FIRST line
import "./instrument";
// ...
// app.module.ts
import { SentryModule } from "@sentry/nestjs/setup";
@Module({ imports: [SentryModule.forRoot()] })
export class AppModule {}
```

**Next.js** — config lives in `sentry.client.config.ts`,
`sentry.server.config.ts`, `sentry.edge.config.ts`, and `next.config.js` is
wrapped with `withSentryConfig`. The wizard (Step 2) writes these; verify the DSN
is read from `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` / `process.env.SENTRY_DSN`.

**React Native / Expo** — wrap the root component:

```ts
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react-native";
Sentry.init({
  dsn: process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN,
  tracesSampleRate: 0.2,
});
export default Sentry.wrap(App);
```

**Python (Django/Flask/FastAPI/generic)** — initialize at startup
(`settings.py`, app factory, or main module):

```python
import os
import sentry_sdk

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn=os.environ["SENTRY_DSN"],
    environment=os.environ.get("ENVIRONMENT", "production"),
    traces_sample_rate=0.1,
    send_default_pii=False,
)
```

Framework-specific integrations (e.g. `DjangoIntegration`, `FastApiIntegration`)
are auto-enabled by the matching extra installed in Step 2.

## Step 4 — DSN via environment

- Store the DSN in an environment variable, never in committed source.
- Add it to `.env.example` (with a placeholder) so the requirement is documented,
  but keep the real value in `.env`/secrets and confirm `.env` is gitignored.
- Use the framework's public-env convention for client-side code:
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` (Next.js), `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` (Vite),
  `EXPO_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` (Expo). Server-only code uses `SENTRY_DSN`.
- For source-map upload (Step 6) the build also needs `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`,
  `SENTRY_ORG`, and `SENTRY_PROJECT` — these are **build/CI** secrets, not
  shipped to the client.

## Step 5 — Error + performance monitoring

- **Errors**: unhandled exceptions/rejections are captured automatically once
  `init` runs; add the framework error handler where required (Express:
  `setupExpressErrorHandler`; React: an error boundary via
  `Sentry.ErrorBoundary`; NestJS: `SentryModule`). Use
  `Sentry.captureException(err)` for caught-but-notable errors.
- **Performance/tracing**: set a `tracesSampleRate` (start ~0.1 in production,
  `1.0` in dev) and enable the framework tracing integration (browser tracing,
  HTTP/DB auto-instrumentation on the server). Optionally add profiling on Node
  via `@sentry/profiling-node` and `profilesSampleRate`.
- Set `environment` and (ideally) `release` so issues are grouped per deploy.

## Step 6 — Source maps (readable stack traces)

Minified/transpiled traces are useless without source maps. Configure upload at
build time:

- **Next.js**: handled by `withSentryConfig` in `next.config.js` (the wizard sets
  it up); ensure `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`/`SENTRY_ORG`/`SENTRY_PROJECT` exist in CI.
- **Vite/Webpack/Rollup/esbuild**: add the Sentry bundler plugin
  (`@sentry/vite-plugin`, `@sentry/webpack-plugin`, etc.) with `sourcemaps`
  upload enabled and the same auth env vars.
- **Node**: build with source maps emitted and upload via
  `sentry-cli sourcemaps upload` (or the bundler plugin) in the release step.
- **React Native**: source maps upload through the Sentry Metro/Gradle/Xcode
  integration added by the SDK's setup.
- Tie uploads to a **release** identifier (commit SHA or version) and inject the
  same release into `Sentry.init({ release })` so traces map to the right build.

## Step 6a — Name custom telemetry consistently

When adding custom span or log attributes, use the current stable Sentry
semantic-convention key for that domain when one exists. Sentry conventions are
aligned with OpenTelemetry in many domains, but Sentry's current convention is
authoritative for data sent to Sentry. Consult only the relevant domain in the
official convention reference, omit deprecated keys, and do not invent a second
name for an established attribute. Keep values low-cardinality and never attach
secrets, credentials, request bodies, or unnecessary personal data.

## Step 7 — Verify

- Build/typecheck to confirm the SDK wiring compiles:
  `bun run build` / `bun run typecheck` (or the project's equivalents).
- Trigger a deliberate test error in a non-production environment and confirm it
  appears in Sentry with a **readable** (source-mapped) stack trace.
- Confirm a transaction/trace shows up to validate performance monitoring.
- Remove the test error afterward.

## Rules

- **Do not port or copy upstream plugin code** — reimplement from scratch.
- Never hard-code or commit a DSN or `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`; route everything
  through env/secrets and update `.env.example`.
- Match the project's package manager and module system; do not introduce a new
  one to install Sentry.
- Initialize Sentry before any other application code runs.
- Tune sample rates for the environment — do not ship `tracesSampleRate: 1.0` to
  high-traffic production by default.
- Prefer current Sentry semantic-convention keys for custom span and log
  attributes; do not use deprecated keys or invent aliases for established ones.
- Verify with a real captured event and a source-mapped trace before declaring
  setup complete.
