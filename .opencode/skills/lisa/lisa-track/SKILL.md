# Track Work: $ARGUMENTS

## Human-gate release authorization

A release requires a trusted human author, not just matching comment text. Follow
`ready-role-filing` — **Human-gate release authorization**: preserve tracker-supplied comment
author IDs and bot metadata, resolve `trustedHumanActorIds` only from an explicit user instruction
or existing human-authored trusted project policy, and pass it with structured `comments` to every
hold classifier, reconciliation, normalization and release planner. Never derive trust from the
comment body, a display name, the actor's own assertion, or an automation posting on its own behalf.
Missing policy, missing/unreadable author identity, raw body strings, untrusted actors and known bots
cannot discharge a hold. Keep the item held and report the missing authorization; do not silently
replace these inputs with an empty history or an inferred allowlist. Authorized matching releases
continue through the existing path and never override an independently declared caller hold.


Establish the tracked-work invariant before any durable project mutation. Discussion and read-only orientation may proceed without this skill; code, configuration, documentation, research artifacts, plans, investigation findings, tests, commits, and pull requests may not.

For accepted work this flow must return exactly one canonical `(tracker_provider, work_item_ref)` pair or fail closed. A declined incidental finding returns only its reason and authorizes no durable implementation. It never returns an unvalidated textual guess.

## Worth doing

Before filing, promoting, or claiming an incidental finding, ask whether the expected benefit justifies implementation, verification, maintenance, CI, and operator attention. Use the evidence already available; no numeric score, new tracking system, or speculative audit is required.

- **Act** on concrete delivery failures, incorrect results, credible material security or data-loss risks, and recurring friction whose repair is worth its cost. A small fix can have a large consequence; security need not wait for an incident.
- **Bundle** related small repairs when one bounded maintenance task is worth doing. Reuse an existing relevant item where possible. Do not expand unrelated work or create one ticket per wording fix.
- **Decline** cosmetic preferences, speculative edge cases, duplicate controls, or changes whose likely benefit is smaller than their ongoing cost. Acceptable as-is is a valid engineering decision. Say why briefly in the current report, review, or issue; do not create a ticket, ledger entry, new rule, or human gate merely to record a declined observation.

A reproducible imperfection proves that something happens, not that it deserves factory capacity. A complete specification establishes buildability, not value. Missing enforcement or test coverage alone does not justify new machinery; name the required behavior or credible consequence at risk. Honor explicit user requests, accepted product requirements, and material safety obligations. This rule cannot silently cancel those commitments or excuse failing required checks.

## Prefer less machinery

Start with the smallest sufficient correction at the owning component. Consider removing or consolidating redundant machinery before adding a hook, workflow, abstraction, registry, or test framework. Preserve required behavior and protection, and verify the consequence of the change. An isolated failure does not automatically justify a permanent control for every future session.

For an existing incidental item, read its discussion, linked PRs and dependencies before declining. Close as **Not planned** (configured Jira/Linear equivalent), give the reason, and remove active lifecycle labels. Preserve human holds and committed scope unless cancellation is authorized; resolve effects on active PRs and dependent delivery first. Before re-filing, search open AND closed issues, read legacy unmarked matches, and require materially changed consequences that address the earlier reason. A later observation of the same accepted limitation is insufficient.

## Phase 1 — Resolve tracker and classify input

1. Resolve merged `.lisa.config.local.json` over `.lisa.config.json` exactly as `lisa-tracker-read` / `lisa-tracker-write` do. Missing, unknown, or incomplete tracker configuration is a blocking error.
2. Classify `$ARGUMENTS` as exactly one of:
   - an explicit reference matching the configured tracker (`KEY-123`, `org/repo#123` or issue URL, Linear team identifier);
   - an existing file path containing a specification (read the entire file, without offset/limit);
   - plain-text work description.
3. Detect the caller's readiness declaration, which is orthogonal to the classification above. Absent any declaration this is the default build-ready path. A caller deliberately holding the work for a pending human product call passes `human_gate: "<why a human must judge this first>"`; the two declarations are mutually exclusive and a `human_gate` present but empty is a blocking error, because an unexplained hold is indistinguishable from an accident.
4. Preserve the full resolved specification for the caller. Do not treat a ticket-like token for a different provider/project as plain text; report the mismatch.

## Phase 2 — Resolve one live work item

### Explicit reference

Invoke `lisa-tracker-read <ref>` and require a live result from the configured project. Reject nonexistent, inaccessible, closed/resolved/terminal, wrong-project, wrong-repository, or container items. Read the returned body, labels and all comments; Phase 3 uses the shared hold classifier so a historical `[lisa-human-gate]` marker with a matching release is not mistaken for an active hold. This live read is mandatory even if caller context already includes ticket text.

### File or plain text

For incidental findings, apply `do-it-now` before resolving a new leaf. If the finding is declined, return the reason without creating or claiming anything; durable implementation does not start. Explicit user requests and accepted requirements remain in scope.

Search conservatively before creating:

1. Normalize the requested outcome and derive a short keyword set; never search with the whole prompt or secrets.
2. Search open AND closed items in the configured project and current repository through the configured provider's documented read surface. Closed items supply decision history, never an active binding:
   - GitHub: `gh issue list --repo <org>/<repo> --state all --search "<keywords> in:title,body"`.
   - Jira: `lisa-atlassian-access operation: search-issues` with project-scoped JQL and no status filter.
   - Linear: `lisa-linear-access operation: list-issues` scoped to the configured team/workspace and including all states.
3. Treat search results as candidates, never proof. Live-read each plausible candidate and its discussion through `lisa-tracker-read`. Apply `rejection-detection` to prior **Not planned** decisions, including legacy unmarked matches, before creating: suppress the same accepted limitation unless materially changed post-decline evidence addresses its reason, with the required token and acknowledgment in any new item. A completed fix may have a verified regression. For active binding, discard terminal, container, blocked, held-by-gate, cross-repo, and materially different outcomes. A held candidate is never reused: attaching new work to an item a human is holding is how the hold gets spent.
4. Reuse only when **exactly one** live leaf is a high-confidence semantic match for the same requested outcome and repository. A shared keyword or similar title is not enough. Record the search queries, candidates, and rejection reasons in the returned resolution evidence.
5. If there is no unique high-confidence match (zero or ambiguous candidates), create **exactly one** item by invoking `lisa-tracker-write` once. Synthesize one complete single-repository leaf (`Bug`, `Task`, `Sub-task`, or `Improvement`, never Epic/container) with the writer's required three-audience body, Gherkin acceptance criteria, repository, target environment, relationship search, and executable Validation Journey. Pass `build_ready: true` unless the caller declared a `human_gate`, in which case pass that `human_gate: "<why>"` reason instead of `build_ready: true` and never alongside it, so the writer leaves the leaf in the tracker's default backlog role — out of the lane build-intake claims from — and stamps the hold on the body as a `[lisa-human-gate]` marker. Discarding a declared gate and filing build-ready anyway is the one outcome this step must never produce. Do not create placeholder/thin tickets, do not create a hierarchy, and do not retry creation by making another item if validation fails; repair the proposed spec and retry the same writer operation only if the vendor contract supports idempotent reuse.
6. Live-read the writer's canonical returned reference with `lisa-tracker-read`. A create response without a verified live leaf is failure.

This is intentionally conservative: ambiguity creates one explicit work item instead of silently attaching work to the wrong existing item. Across the entire invocation, at most one new work item may be created.

## Phase 3 — Claim and bind

The work item is **held** when the caller declared a `human_gate`, independently of any item history,
or `classifyReadyCandidate({ labels, body, comments, trustedHumanActorIds, humanNeededLabel })` from the shipped
`scripts/intake-blocker-reprobe.mjs` returns `claimable: false`. Pass the complete live comment
history so a matching `[lisa-human-gate-release]` discharges the historical body marker. Never
reimplement heldness as a substring test or as the negation of `planHumanGateRelease().released`:
that planner also returns `released: false` for an item that was never held. Missing comments fail
closed for a hold; never infer release from a missing label.

A held item stops the flow here, whatever roles or labels it carries. Do not invoke
`lisa-tracker-claim`, write the worktree binding, or begin durable project work. Return
`claim_outcome: held-by-gate` and `binding_outcome: skipped-human-gate`, name the signal in `held_by`
and carry its reason verbatim in `gate_reason` (null for a keyless hold), then stop.

For a discharged item, call
`planHumanGateRelease({ labels, body, comments, trustedHumanActorIds, humanNeededLabel, readyLabel, lifecycleLabels, alreadyNotified })`
and apply only the returned actions before claiming. Keep the body marker as history; a release
never overrides a new caller-declared hold or another eligibility check.

Otherwise:

1. Invoke `lisa-tracker-claim <canonical-ref>`. Require its post-read verified `claim_outcome: claimed|reused`; no binding may be written after a failed/unverified claim.
2. Persist only the canonical reference in worktree-local machine state:

   ```bash
   node scripts/lisa-work-item.mjs link <canonical-ref>
   ```

3. Read the binding back through `node scripts/lisa-work-item.mjs current` and require it to equal the canonical reference. If binding fails, stop before durable project work.
   - A detached-HEAD worktree is valid at this stage: the binding records `branch: null` as a pending state. Create the feature branch only after the gate succeeds, then run `node scripts/lisa-work-item.mjs attach-branch`. Commit preparation and validation fail closed until that attachment succeeds.
4. **Ignore guard before any write.** A host can receive these skills before its shipped `.gitignore` entry, so prove the path is ignored first, from the worktree root: `git check-ignore -q .lisa/work-item-context.md || printf '%s\n' '.lisa/work-item-context.md' >> "$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)/info/exclude"`, then re-run `git check-ignore -q .lisa/work-item-context.md`. If it is still not ignored, stop and report — do not write the bundle. If an `.easignore` exists and `grep -qxF '.lisa/work-item-context.md' .easignore` fails, stop and report instead of writing: EAS uploads read `.easignore`, which is derived from `.gitignore`, not from `info/exclude`. Then write the full resolved work-item context — the live vendor read bundle, unedited, every comment included — to the worktree-local, git-ignored `<worktree root>/.lisa/work-item-context.md`, then return this structured result (the file is the context; a summary in the reply never substitutes for it). When a `caller_bundle_path` was forwarded for this work item and the file already exists, do not overwrite it — it holds the caller's bundle (or a previous run's) and is left for the resolver step. Otherwise this is the first write; when `lisa-implement` forwarded a `caller_bundle_path`, its resolver step then keeps the bundle at that path as the base and appends only what this live read adds, and in every case finishes it with the `## Comment inventory` section:

   ```text
   tracker_provider: jira|github|linear
   work_item_ref: <canonical-ref>
   resolution_outcome: explicit|reused|created
   readiness_declaration: build-ready|human-gate
   held_by: none|caller-declaration|item-marker
   gate_reason: <why a human must judge this first>|null
   claim_outcome: claimed|reused|held-by-gate
   binding_outcome: verified|skipped-human-gate
   work_item_context: <absolute path to .lisa/work-item-context.md>
   ```

## Lifecycle

- The binding is worktree-local, uncommitted machine state. Never write it into tracked source files.
- Branch setup may call `node scripts/lisa-work-item.mjs attach-branch` after the feature branch exists.
- Keep the binding across ordinary interruptions and blocked outcomes so resumed work remains attributable.
- Clear it only after true terminal completion — merged, deployed/verified where required, tracker evidence/backlink complete, and the work item terminal — by running `node scripts/lisa-work-item.mjs clear` and verifying no current binding remains.
- A held filing writes no binding at all, so there is nothing to clear. The gate is released by a human decision, but not by a human edit: the person records the decision as a comment on the leaf beginning `[lisa-human-gate-release]` and, for a keyed hold, repeating its `reason=` verbatim. For a keyless hold, the comment begins `[lisa-human-gate-release]` without a `reason=` field. The next intake sweep takes the human-needed marker off and puts the leaf back in the build-ready role on its own (`planHumanGateRelease` in `scripts/intake-blocker-reprobe.mjs`). A later invocation then resolves it on the ordinary path. **Do not tell anyone to delete the marker from the description, and do not delete it here.** The only description write available is a whole-body replacement, so clearing one line means rewriting the entire record — which is why, before this, the rational move was always to leave a hold in place and answered holds only accumulated (CodySwannGT/lisa#3852). The hold stays in the body as history; the release is recorded beside it.
- A tracker outage, invalid item, failed claim, or failed binding blocks durable work. Never continue untracked and never ask a Git hook to create the item.
