# plugin, which lives in the user's home directory and is emphatically NOT part
# of a clone. A fresh remote container is the second case every time: it clones
# the repository and has never run a plugin install.
#
# So the agent directories are searched first — they are the cheapest hit and
# need nothing installed — and the npm package is the fallback that makes the
# plugin-delivered harnesses work at all. Lisa is a dependency of every project
# it is applied to, so `node_modules` carries the same skill at the version that
# project pins, which is the version its setup should run.
#
# `plugins/lisa/skills/` sits between them, and exists for exactly one project:
# Lisa itself. There the checkout IS Lisa, at HEAD, while `node_modules` holds
# whatever version its own lockfile pins — which was four months and a hundred
# skills behind, so this file did not exist there at all and setup aborted
# claiming the skill could not be found. The one place it was is the only place
# that was not searched. It is ahead of node_modules because a checkout that
# builds this skill is newer than any published copy of it, and harmless
# everywhere else because no other project has that directory.
