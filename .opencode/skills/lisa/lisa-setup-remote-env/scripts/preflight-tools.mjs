/**
 * Prove, before an agent starts work, that the CLIs it needs are on PATH.
 *
 * The symmetric half of `preflight-secrets.mjs`, and it exists for the same
 * reason: the logic to answer the question was already good, and nothing asked
 * it at the moment the answer mattered. `planToolchain` decides presence,
 * minimum version, and installability correctly — but its only callers were
 * `/lisa:setup:local-env`, which a human runs deliberately, and container
 * provisioning. An agent on a laptop could claim a ticket, cut a branch, and
 * discover `maestro` was never installed forty minutes later.
 *
 * **This is a caller, not a checker.** Every decision comes from
 * `planToolchain`. Writing a second implementation is exactly the defect this
 * change also fixes elsewhere — `verify-remote-env.mjs` grew its own toolchain
 * check that forgot `minVersion`, so a container verified clean against a node
 * older than the manifest demanded. One function, one verdict, no drift.
 *
 * **Three verdicts, and the third one was learned the hard way.** The original
 * header here claimed two sufficed: `preflight-secrets` needs `unreachable`
 * because a vault can fail to be asked, and "probing a local binary cannot: it
 * is present or it is not." That sentence was true of probing and false of this
 * module, because one branch of `planToolchain` never probed at all — an
 * install entry with no pin for the running platform short-circuited to
 * `invalid` before the binary was looked for. So a `bws` that was installed, on
 * PATH, and resolving secrets in the very same session was reported under
 * "These need you", next to an instruction to route the work to blocked. Four
 * operator sessions believed it.
 *
 * The third tier is `unverified`: present and usable, but with no pin for this
 * platform, so Lisa can neither reinstall it nor say where it came from. That
 * is a real thing to know — an unpinned binary is a supply-chain claim nobody
 * checked — and it is emphatically not a reason to stop. Availability and
 * provenance are two questions, and answering the first with the second is the
 * defect this tier exists to prevent recurring.
 *
 * The analogous trap — a tool whose version cannot be parsed — is
 * already handled correctly upstream, because `planRequired` compares
 * `found.version ?? "0"` and an unknown version loses every `minVersion`
 * comparison. It fails closed without needing a verdict of its own.
 *
 * **The one thing tools have that credentials do not** is a self-service
 * remedy. An `install` entry is pinned and checksummed, so "missing" splits
 * into "Lisa can place this for you" and "you must act". A credential can never
 * be self-provisioned, which is why that distinction has no secrets equivalent.
 * @module preflight-tools
