/**
 * Prepare a remote environment: toolchain, then secrets, then the project hook.
 *
 * This is the script a remote environment's setup **and** maintenance fields
 * call. They are the same script on purpose. A container may be built fresh or
 * resumed from cache, and every step here is idempotent and version-aware, so
 * running it twice is correct.
 *
 * Order matters. The toolchain comes first because the secrets step needs the
 * provider CLI that the toolchain installs. The project hook comes last because
 * it is the only part that may assume everything else is ready.
 *
 * **Which phases run depends on the surface, and the reason is not cosmetic.**
 * On a surface that re-runs this script when a container resumes, materializing
 * here is what picks up a rotated value. On a surface that *skips* it whenever a
 * filesystem cache exists, materializing here would write the value once and
 * then never refresh it — a rotated credential would stay stale until the cache
 * expired. Those surfaces materialize from a session-start hook instead, which
 * runs every session including resumed ones, and `--phase=secrets` is how that
 * hook re-enters this file.
 *
 * The selection comes from the surface's `materializeAt` capability rather than
 * from its name, so adding a surface does not mean editing a branch here.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   setup-remote-env.mjs [--dry-run] [--phase=toolchain|secrets|hook]

/**
 * The setup field, identical for every project and every surface.

 * Names neither the repository nor its package manager, and deliberately not

 * runs it inside the checkout, Claude Code web runs it from `$HOME` with the
 * checkout one level down, and on Codex Cloud the checkout is not under `$HOME`
 * at all — so a `$HOME` glob matched nothing there and bash was handed a path
 * still containing a literal asterisk.
 *
 * Candidates are therefore tried relative to cwd first, then under `$HOME` and
 * `/workspace` — the container roots the two surfaces actually use — because
 * cwd is not reliably either of them. A Claude environment reported `$HOME` as
 * `/root` with no checkout beneath it, which a cwd-only search cannot reach.
 *
 * EVERY match is prepared rather than the first. A Claude Code web environment
 * can hold more than one checkout, so stopping at the first hit would prepare
 * whichever repository sorts first and silently ignore the rest — arbitrary
 * rather than merely limited. Each script anchors itself on its own repository
 * root and each project materializes under its own `secrets.namespace`, so
 * preparing several is well defined rather than a collision. Matches are
 * deduplicated by resolved directory, since the candidate globs overlap
 * whenever cwd happens to be one of the roots.
 *
 * The status is the first failure and every checkout is still attempted: one
 * broken repository must neither hide the others nor report success.
 *
 * Preparing nothing has two causes, and they are not the same failure:
 *
 *   - A checkout is present but carries no entrypoint. That is a
 *     misconfiguration, and a `for` loop over a glob that matches nothing exits
 *     0 on its own — the quiet success this has always guarded against. It
 *     still fails loudly, printing the layout it found rather than only the
 *     path it wanted.
 *   - There is NO checkout. A Claude Tag channel session runs as the
 *     organization with no user account, and a repository does not enter the
 *     session until a request names one, so this is an ordinary state rather
 *     than an error. Failing here would be severe: a setup script that exits
 *     non-zero stops the session from starting at all, so the old blanket
 *     `exit 1` would have killed every repo-less channel session.
 *
 * With no checkout, `LISA_SECRETS_NAMESPACE` decides whether there is anything
 * to do: it names the tenant, which is the one value no default can supply.
 * Given it, the machine itself is prepared — tools and credentials, no repo
 * required. Without it there is nothing to prepare and nothing to fail about.
 *
 * Those two preparation steps report their failures and do not propagate them,
 * which is deliberate and is NOT the same as hiding them. A setup script that
 * exits non-zero stops the session from starting at all, so propagating turns
 * "no credentials this session" into "no session" — strictly worse, and the
 * exact regression that killed every repo-less channel session once already.
 * What was wrong before was the silence: a bare `|| true` let a container come
 * up with a bootstrap token and nothing able to use it, looking identical to
 * success. Each phase's status is now captured and named on stderr, which the
 * vendor surfaces, so the session still starts and the operator can see which
 * half is missing.
 *
 * Failure prints the layout it found rather than only the path it wanted. This
 * field lives in a vendor settings box with a slow edit-and-retry loop, and a
 * miss that reports nothing costs a whole round trip to learn one fact; the
 * listing means the next message names the layout instead of repeating it.
 *
 * A field that named the repository and package manager was a string a human
 * had to get right, in a settings box with no review, no version history and no
 * test — and the logic it encoded belongs in a file that has all three.
