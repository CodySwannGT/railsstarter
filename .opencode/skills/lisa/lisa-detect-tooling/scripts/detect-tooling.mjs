 * binary on PATH, and nothing populates it. So a project can ship npm scripts
 * that invoke `maestro`, wire an MCP server whose CLI it also shells out to, and
 * declare Playwright coverage thresholds, while the manifest that actually
 * provisions binaries stays empty and every one of those fails at the moment of
 * use rather than at setup.
 *
 * This program only ever *proposes*. It writes nothing, installs nothing, and
 * emits manifest entries with the fields a human still has to fill — a pinned
 * version, a URL, a checksum. That boundary is the point: a tool should reach a
 * machine because someone reviewed a pinned entry, never because a detector was
