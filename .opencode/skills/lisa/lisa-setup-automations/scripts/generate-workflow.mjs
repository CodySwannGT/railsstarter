/**
 * Generate the GitHub Actions workflow that fires a registered automation loop.
 *
 * Once `executionEnv` exists, a scheduled loop is a thin dispatcher: it wakes,
 * picks eligible work, submits it to a remote surface, records the identifier,
 * and exits. The heavy lifting happens elsewhere. That makes the clock's job
 * cheap and boring, and the requirements on it are availability rather than
 * power.
 *
 * The workflow is generated from `.lisa.config.json` rather than hand-written,
 * so config stays the source of truth and swapping the scheduler later is a
 * config change instead of a rewrite.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   generate-workflow.mjs <loop-name> [--write]
