# Sentry Access: $ARGUMENTS

Single chokepoint for Sentry operations. Caller skills MUST NOT call
`mcp__sentry__*`, `sentry-cli`, or `https://sentry.io/api/` directly.

## Invocation Contract

```text
operation: list-issues org:<ORG> project:<PROJECT> query:<QUERY> [environment:<ENV>]
operation: get-issue issue_id:<ID>
operation: events org:<ORG> project:<PROJECT> query:<QUERY>
operation: releases org:<ORG> project:<PROJECT>
```

Return parsed JSON in a `<result>` block.

## Substrate Selection

Probe in order — the ordering is the shared `credential-substrate-precedence`
contract, not a Sentry-local choice. The first tier that is ready **and**
identity-matches the configured org/project is used; a substrate authenticated
against a different org is skipped, never used.

1. **Tier 1 — configured-provider substrate: `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`** bearer token
   against Sentry REST, resolved through `lisa-secrets-access`.
2. **Tier 1a — `sentry-cli`**, if installed and authenticated to the requested
   org/project from that same token (the CLI arm of the provider substrate).
3. **Tier 2 — interactive MCP fallback: Sentry MCP**, if available and
   authenticated. Used when tier 1 is genuinely unavailable: no
   `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`, no REST/CLI adapter for the operation, or a Sentry outage.

Sentry documents API auth tokens for REST API calls, and the same token works
interactively and headlessly — which is why it leads. The REST tier uses:

```bash
# Resolve the token through the chokepoint before giving up on the environment.
# `$SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` is the documented fallback, not the only rung: without
# this, a project that keeps its credentials in Bitwarden, Doppler, or AWS has
# no tier 1 path at all and silently resolves through the interactive MCP —
# the exact divergence `credential-substrate-precedence` exists to remove.
# Mirrors `linear-access`, `atlassian-access`, and `notion-access`.
read_sentry_token() {
  [ -n "${SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN:-}" ] && { echo "$SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN"; return; }
  #
  # Ordered across trusted machine-managed substrates, ending at the installed
  # package. Checkout-local paths are deliberately absent: a familiar generated
  # destination is still repository-controlled executable code. The plugin
  # rungs are the floor: `resolve-secret.mjs` ships beside this skill, so a rung
  # pointing at it is reachable from anywhere the plugin itself is installed.
  # Without one, a consumer repository that vendors none of the leading paths
  # never reaches a resolver at all — the ladder exits without having asked
  # anything, which is what pushed agents into improvising their own credential
  # lookups. This LADDER is identical in every skill that resolves a credential
  # and `credential-resolver-ladder` fails if any copy diverges. Only what
  # happens AFTER the ladder may differ between them.
  # Execute only machine-managed plugin/package resolvers. Checkout-local
  # candidates are repository-controlled code, not trusted merely by path.
  local candidates=()
  if [ -n "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-}" ]; then
    candidates+=("$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/lisa-secrets-access/scripts/resolve-secret.mjs")
  fi
  if [ -n "${PLUGIN_ROOT:-}" ]; then
    candidates+=("$PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/lisa-secrets-access/scripts/resolve-secret.mjs")
  fi
  # Last rung deliberately needs no environment variable: an agent that was
  # never handed a plugin root still has the installed package to fall back on.
  candidates+=(node_modules/@codyswann/lisa/plugins/lisa/skills/lisa-secrets-access/scripts/resolve-secret.mjs)

  local resolver
  local tried=()
  for resolver in "${candidates[@]}"; do
    tried+=("$resolver")
    if [ -f "$resolver" ]; then
      local via_lisa
      via_lisa=$(node "$resolver" get SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN 2>/dev/null) \
        && [ -n "$via_lisa" ] && { echo "$via_lisa"; return; }
      # Empty/error means this substrate had no answer; try the next trusted one.
    fi
  done
  # Name every path. A bare `return 1` sends the next reader hunting for a
  # resolver they cannot see the absence of; the enumeration turns that into a
  # seconds-long diagnosis. Paths and store coordinates only — never any
  # resolved value, on any path.
  echo "Error: could not resolve SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN through lisa-secrets-access." >&2
  echo "Tried, in order (relative paths are from $PWD):" >&2
  printf '  %s\n' "${tried[@]}" >&2
  return 1
}

sentry_api() {
  local path="$1"
  local token
  token=$(read_sentry_token) || {
    echo "Error: no Sentry auth token. Set SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN, or store it as" >&2
    echo "SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN in this project's secrets provider." >&2
    return 1
  }
  curl -sS "https://sentry.io/api/0${path}" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $token"
}
```

Tier 1a authenticates `sentry-cli` from the **same resolved token**
(`SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=$(read_sentry_token) sentry-cli …`) — never from a second
credential store, and never from an interactive `sentry-cli login` keychain.

If neither tier works, fail with:

```text
Error: no Sentry access substrate available. Authenticate Sentry MCP/CLI or set SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN.
```

## Mutation boundary

Every operation in the Invocation Contract is **read-only** — issue, event, and
release retrieval. So the `credential-substrate-precedence` guarded fallback for
mutating operations (write, read back, assert the tenant from the response, roll
back on mismatch) is not engaged here, and a failed tier is simply skipped. Any
future operation that mutates Sentry state — resolving an issue, editing a
release — is a write and MUST reconcile by read-back under that protocol before
any retry; do not add one to the contract without it.

## Invariants

- Tier order is `credential-substrate-precedence`: `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` first, the
  Sentry MCP as a preserved first-class fallback. Identity-match against the
  configured org/project is mandatory on every tier.
- The token is resolved through `lisa-secrets-access`, with the bare
  `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable as the documented fallback. Never read
  a second credential store (OS keychain, `~/.sentryclirc` token) directly — the
  one-store rule lives at the chokepoint.
- Org/project come from `.sentryclirc`, `.lisa.config.json`, or explicit
  operation args; never infer by searching all accessible orgs.
- Consumer skills do not embed Sentry REST paths.
