# Write GitHub Issue: $ARGUMENTS

On runtimes without the rule tree (Antigravity), read **Worth doing** in `lisa-track` for the same value and decline policy.

## Before creating incidental work

Apply `do-it-now`'s **Worth doing** guidance before drafting a new incidental item. Decline low-value observations without writing a ticket or requesting a human gate; report the reason briefly to the caller. A complete spec is not evidence of value. This does not cancel explicit user requests or accepted requirements. Honor prior Not planned decisions through `rejection-detection`, including legacy issues without markers. Accepted work continues through the existing validation and readiness contract below.

## Human-gate release authorization

A release requires a trusted human author, not just matching comment text. Follow
`ready-role-filing` — **Human-gate release authorization**: preserve tracker-supplied comment
author IDs and bot metadata, resolve `trustedHumanActorIds` only from an explicit user instruction
or existing human-authored trusted project policy, and pass it with structured `comments` to every
hold classifier, reconciliation, normalization and release planner. Never derive trust from the
comment body, a display name, the actor's own assertion, or an automation posting on its own behalf.
Missing policy, missing/unreadable author identity, raw body strings, untrusted actors and known bots
cannot discharge a hold. Keep the item held and report the missing authorization; do not silently
replace these inputs with an empty history or an inferred allowlist. Authorized matching releases
continue through the existing path and never override an independently declared caller hold.


Create or update a GitHub Issue with all required relationships, metadata, and quality gates. Every section below is mandatory. Thin issues are rejected.

This skill is the GitHub counterpart of `lisa-jira-write-ticket`. The two skills share the same gates, description structure, acceptance-criteria format, and verification flow. The data-model translation is documented under "GitHub Issues data model" below — keep that table in sync with `lisa-github-validate-issue` so what one skill writes the other accepts.

Repository name for scoped comments: `basename $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)`.

## Writing by another path? The gates still apply

A team that talks to its tracker through its own script is doing a normal
thing — the script usually owns the credential plumbing, and Lisa neither
controls nor wants to control it. What that script does NOT get is either half
of this skill's quality gate, and nothing about the write says so.

**A read-back is not the missing check.** A bespoke path almost always re-reads
the issue after writing and confirms the tracker stored what was sent. That is
worth doing and it is not this. It proves TRANSPORT: the API accepted the
payload and the field values round-tripped. It cannot fail for the reason these
gates exist, because it never looks at whether what was sent was any good — a
issue with no acceptance criteria, no parent, and a human decision left sitting
in the middle of it round-trips perfectly. That is the dangerous half of the
shape: a failing control gets investigated, a misread one gets trusted.

So a write by any other path still owes both phases, and both run standalone
against an item that already exists:

| Phase | Skill | What it costs you |
|---|---|---|
| Pre-write validate | `lisa-github-validate-issue` | Run it on the draft before you send it |
| Post-write verify | `lisa-github-verify` | Run it on the live issue after you send it |

```text
Skill(lisa-github-validate-issue) with the draft issue, or with a reference to a live one
Skill(lisa-github-verify) with owner/repo#1234
```

**These are plugin-resident skills invoked through the Skill tool.** They are
not shell scripts and will not appear in any repository's `scripts/` directory,
including yours. An agent that searches the repo it is standing in, finds
nothing, and concludes the capability is absent has made the one mistake that
turns a local script from the convenient option into the only one.

## Prerequisites

- `gh` CLI installed and authenticated (`gh auth status` must succeed). The skill never falls back to a different transport — if `gh` is unauthenticated, stop and surface the auth error.
- `.lisa.config.json` must declare `github.org` and `github.repo` for the destination repository. The configured repo is the issue's home; pass it on every `gh` invocation via `--repo <org>/<repo>`.
- `jq` installed (used to parse `gh` JSON outputs without hand-rolling parsers).

## Phase 1 — Resolve Intent

Determine from `$ARGUMENTS` and context whether this is a CREATE or UPDATE:

- **CREATE**: no existing issue ref provided.
- **UPDATE**: an issue ref provided (`org/repo#<number>` or a full `https://github.com/<org>/<repo>/issues/<number>` URL). Call `lisa-github-read-issue <ref>` first to load the full current state before editing. Never overwrite without reading.

Resolve `<ORG>` and `<REPO>` from the ref or from `.lisa.config.json`.

## Phase 2 — Gather Required Inputs

| Field | Required For | Notes |
|-------|--------------|-------|
| Issue type | CREATE | `Epic`, `Story`, `Task`, `Bug`, `Sub-task`, `Spike`, `Improvement`. Encoded as a label `type:<value>`. |
| Summary (title) | CREATE, UPDATE | One line, imperative voice, under 100 chars. |
| Description (body) | CREATE, UPDATE | Multi-section markdown — see Phase 3. |
| Parent sub-issue | Non-bug, non-epic | Native GitHub sub-issue link. Enforced by `lisa-github-verify`. |
| Priority | CREATE | Label `priority:<low|medium|high|critical>`. |
| Acceptance criteria | Story, Task, Bug, Sub-task, Improvement | Gherkin in `## Acceptance Criteria` — see Phase 3. |
| Validation Journey | Runtime-behavior changes | Delegate to `/github-add-journey`. |
| Target backend environment | Runtime-behavior changes | For every work type, use an exact `deploy.branches` key when an environment is known. Human: bare key or `Confirmed: <env>`. Automation: `Inferred: <env> — evidence: <title\|body\|reproduction\|hostname>`, `Assumption: <env> — remote default branch <branch>` for a unique reverse-map, or `Assumption: remote default branch <branch>` otherwise. Human confirmation replaces an automated annotation with the bare key or `Confirmed: <env>`. |
| Sign-in account / credentials | Authenticated-surface tickets | Recorded under `## Sign-in Required`. |
| Repository | Bug, Task, Sub-task | GitHub Issues live in exactly one repo by definition — record the repo name under `## Repository`, and reject any AC bullet that references a different repo. |
| Source Requirement | PRD-sourced issues (`prd_source` provided) | `## Source Requirement` with PRD link + verbatim requirement quote(s) — see Phase 3; enforced at every level, sub-issues included. |

Optional but recommended: assignee, milestone, components (label `component:<name>`), story points (label `points:<n>`), labels.

Use `gh api repos/<org>/<repo>/labels --paginate` to discover existing labels before referencing one. If a required label doesn't exist (e.g., `type:Story`, `status:ready`, `priority:high`), create it via `gh label create <name> --color <hex> --description <desc> --repo <org>/<repo>`. The first run on a fresh repo will create the full label set; subsequent runs reuse them.

## Phase 3 — Description Quality

The description (issue body) MUST address three audiences. Reject and rewrite if any are missing.

```markdown
## Source Requirement
[Required whenever the issue originates from a PRD (the caller passes
 `prd_source`). Answers "why was this done?" — cite the PRD and quote the
 requirement(s) VERBATIM, never paraphrased:
 - **PRD**: <PRD title + link> §"<section heading>"
 - **Requirement (R3)**: "<verbatim requirement text from the PRD>"
 One Requirement line per satisfied requirement. Derived / cross-cutting
 work that traces to no single requirement uses the supporting form:
 "Derived work supporting R3, R7 — no single PRD section." Close with:
 "This issue exists to satisfy the quoted requirement. If implementation
 scope drifts from the quoted text, the PRD is the authority — raise the
 conflict rather than silently reinterpreting it." Omit the section only
 for ad-hoc issues with no PRD lineage.]

## Context / Business Value
[Why this matters. Stakeholder-facing. Concrete user impact or business outcome.
 Link to the originating Slack thread, PRD page, incident, or customer report.]

## Technical Approach
[Developer-facing. Integration points, impacted modules, data model implications,
 relevant tradeoffs. Not a full design doc — a pointer for someone picking it up.]

## Acceptance Criteria
```gherkin
Scenario: <name>
  Given <precondition>
  When <action>
  Then <observable outcome>

Scenario: <name>
  Given <precondition>
  When <action>
  Then <observable outcome>
```

## Out of Scope
[Explicit list of what this issue does NOT cover. Forces scope discipline.]

## Target Backend Environment
[ALWAYS required on a leaf — the SECTION is unconditional, only its
 VALUE is conditional. It is where `runtime_behavior_change` is
 persisted, so omitting it records nothing rather than recording "no".
 When the issue changes runtime behavior, use an exact
 `deploy.branches` key. A human-confirmed value is a bare key or
 `Confirmed: <env>`. An automated evidence write is
 `Inferred: <env> — evidence: <title|body|reproduction|hostname>`; an automated
 generic default is `Assumption: <env> — remote default branch <branch>`.
 Without a unique reverse-map use `Assumption: remote default branch <branch>`.
 Human confirmation replaces the automated annotation with a bare key or
 `Confirmed: <env>`. ALWAYS render this section — it is where
 `runtime_behavior_change` is persisted, and an absent section reads as
 *underivable*, not exempt. Work that changes no runtime behavior declares the
 exemption in place of an environment: `None — no runtime behavior change:
 doc-only` (or `config-only` / `type-only`). An Epic/container declares
 `None — container: state rolls up from children`. Visible prose, not an HTML
 comment, for the same reason the Branch Plan provenance line is: JIRA's ADF has
 no comment node. See the `derived-branch-plan` rule.]

## Branch Plan
[GENERATED, never hand-authored. Render only when the issue has a Target
 Backend Environment; omit entirely when `runtime_behavior_change = false`
 (doc-only / config-only / type-only) or for an Epic/container — absence is
 correct there. Derive per the `derived-branch-plan` rule: resolve the
 environment, map it forward through `.lisa.config.json` `deploy.branches`,
 and prove the branch exists on the remote. Do not accept caller-supplied
 branches; recompute them. Exactly three lines:
   Branch from: <branch>
   PR into: <branch>
   Derived from: Target Backend Environment <env> via .lisa.config.json deploy.branches
 Both fields name the same branch by construction. A missing, ambiguous, or
 non-unique mapping, or a branch absent from the remote, STOPS the write —
 never default to `main` or the remote default to keep the write alive.]

## Sign-in Required
[Include this section ONLY if the work touches authenticated surfaces.
 Specify: the account/role, where to get the credentials (1Password item,
 env var, seeded fixture), and any MFA/SSO notes.]

## Repository
[Required for Bug / Task / Sub-task. Name the single repo this issue covers.
 If the work spans repos, this issue type is wrong — split into per-repo
 Tasks/Sub-tasks under a parent Story or Epic.]

## Source Artifacts
[Group by domain (UI / UX flow / Data / Ops / Reference). One bullet per
 artifact with title and URL. Inherited from the parent epic per the rules
 in lisa-tracker-source-artifacts.]

## Source Precedence
[When artifacts are attached, name the authoritative source per axis:
 business rules → PRD body, visual treatment → mocks, flow → prototypes,
 API/data → data artifacts. Cross-axis conflicts go under Open Questions.]

## Links
[Remote links: PRs (`Resolves <org>/<repo>#<pr>`), Confluence pages,
 dashboards, incident tickets. Native `Resolves #<pr>` lines are picked up
 by GitHub for auto-close.]

## Relationship Search
[Document the git+search outcomes from Phase 4b. "Searched git history
 for `<keywords>` and `gh issue list` for label `component:X`; no related
 work found." A no-result outcome is acceptable when documented.]

## Validation Journey
[Delegate to /github-add-journey if the issue changes runtime behavior.
 Skip only for doc-only, config-only, or type-only issues. Cross-work-item
 evidence pointers use `[EVIDENCE-REF: <work-item-ref> | <artifact-type>: <kebab-case-name>]`;
 they never replace this issue's local S14 marker.]
```

Rules:
- PRD-sourced issues (caller passed `prd_source`) MUST carry the Source Requirement section with verbatim quotes — paraphrases are rejected (validator gate S16). This applies at every level, sub-issues included: a leaf claimed in isolation must explain its own "why".
- Every acceptance criterion uses Given/When/Then. No vague "should work" language.
- Every criterion is independently verifiable.
- If the issue is a Bug, include reproduction steps, expected vs. actual behavior, and environment.
- If the issue is a Spike, include the question being answered and the definition of done.
- If sign-in is required, the implementer must be able to sign in from the description alone.

## Phase 4 — Relationship Discovery (Mandatory)

### 4a. Parent sub-issue

If the issue is not a Bug and not an Epic, it MUST have a parent sub-issue:

1. If explicitly provided, use that issue number.
2. Otherwise search active Epic issues:
   ```bash
   gh issue list --repo <org>/<repo> --label type:Epic --state open --json number,title,body --limit 100
   ```
   Match on keywords from the summary and description.
3. If no Epic matches, stop and ask the human to create or pick one. Do NOT orphan the issue.

### 4b. Related issues

Run BOTH searches and document outcomes — never declare "no related work" without doing both.

**Search 1: local git history**

```bash
git log --all --oneline --grep="<keyword>"
git log --all --oneline -- <path-or-glob>
git log --since=90.days --oneline -- <path-or-glob>
```

If a PR or commit surfaces, capture the PR URL — it becomes a Phase 4c link.

**Search 2: GitHub issue search**

```bash
gh issue list --repo <org>/<repo> --search "<keyword>" --state all --limit 50 --json number,title,state,labels,updatedAt
gh issue list --repo <org>/<repo> --label "component:<component>" --state open --limit 100 --json number,title,state
gh issue list --repo <org>/<repo> --search "epic:#<epic-number>" --state all --limit 50 --json number,title,state
```

For each candidate, classify the relationship using these markdown conventions in the issue body (under `## Links`):

| Link type | How it's encoded |
|-----------|------------------|
| `blocks` | `Blocks #<number>` (or full `org/repo#<number>` for cross-repo) |
| `is blocked by` | `Blocked by #<number>` |
| `relates to` | `Relates to #<number>` |
| `duplicates` | `Duplicates #<number>` (and close one as duplicate via `gh issue close <number> --reason "duplicate of #<other>"`) |
| `clones` | `Cloned from #<number>` |

GitHub does not have a native typed-link primitive for issues (only `Resolves #<pr>` for PR↔Issue). The text conventions above are parsed by `lisa-github-read-issue` to reconstruct the relationship graph.

### 4c. Remote links

Identify and attach (under `## Links`):
- Related GitHub PRs, branches, or commits.
- Confluence / Notion / Linear PRD pages (the originating PRD).
- Dashboards (Grafana, Datadog, Sentry).
- **Source artifacts from the originating PRD / parent Epic**: classify and inherit per `lisa-tracker-source-artifacts`. Inherit by domain — UI → `ui-design` + `ux-flow`; backend → `data`; infra → `ops`; always inherit `reference`. Never assume a developer will walk up to the Epic to find design context.

If the issue was generated from a PRD and the parent Epic has no source artifacts, surface that as a smell and ask whether artifacts were missed during extraction.

### 4d. Source Precedence (must appear in description)

Same rule as `lisa-jira-write-ticket` Phase 4d — record source precedence under `## Source Precedence` (or a paragraph under `## Technical Approach`) when artifacts are attached. Cross-axis conflicts go under `## Open Questions`.

### 4e. Live Product Walkthrough Findings (UI-touching issues)

If the issue modifies an existing user-facing surface, a `lisa-product-walkthrough` should already have been run upstream. Inherit findings under `## Current Product`.

## Phase 5 — Set Metadata

GitHub Issues uses **labels** for the structured metadata that JIRA stores in custom fields. Apply the conventions:

| Concept | Label format | Example |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| Issue type | `type:<value>` | `type:Epic`, `type:Story`, `type:Task`, `type:Bug`, `type:Sub-task`, `type:Spike`, `type:Improvement` |
| Status | `status:<value>` | `status:ready`, `status:in-progress`, `status:on-dev`, `status:done` |
| Priority | `priority:<value>` | `priority:low`, `priority:medium`, `priority:high`, `priority:critical` |
| Components | `component:<name>` | `component:auth`, `component:billing` |
| Story points | `points:<n>` | `points:3`, `points:5`, `points:8` |
| Fix version | `fix-version:<value>` | `fix-version:2.7.0` |
| Repo (multi-repo orgs) | implicit (issue lives in the repo) | — |
| Triage marker | `claude-triaged-<repo>` | `claude-triaged-frontend-v2` |

Milestones map to `fix-version:<value>` labels OR native GitHub Milestones — pick one convention per repo and document it in `.lisa.config.json` if needed. Default to labels for parity with the JIRA fix-version concept.

Create labels lazily — call `gh label create` if a referenced label doesn't exist. Use a stable color palette per category so the issue board reads cleanly.

### Build-ready label is leaf-only

The build-ready status label (`status:ready`) is governed by the `leaf-only-lifecycle` rule. **Apply `status:ready` only when the issue is a leaf work unit** — an individually implementable issue type (`Bug`, `Task`, `Sub-task`, `Improvement`) that has **no child work**. A container (`Epic`, `Story`, `Spike`, or *any* issue that has sub-issues) is **never** written with `status:ready`; its lifecycle state rolls up from its children. The classification is structural: an item is a container if it has child work, regardless of its declared type (see the childless-parent exception in the rule). Do not hand-apply `status:ready` to a parent.

For non-build-ready issues created fresh (Epics, Stories, and other containers), omit the status label entirely; the container's rollup state is derived, not set directly.

### Build-ready control input (`build_ready`)

`build_ready` is a write-control input governed by the `ready-role-filing` rule — cite that slug for the full contract; do not restate its per-vendor normalization table here. It decides whether a **leaf** work unit is stamped with the build-ready role on create. It never overrides `leaf-only-lifecycle` — a container is never stamped build-ready regardless of `build_ready`. "Not build-ready" is not a special status: it simply means the issue is created in its natural default (a plain open issue with **no `status:ready` label**), which a human can promote later.

- **Omitted** → **not build-ready**: the leaf is created without `status:ready`. Ready is an explicit claim, never a vendor default. **This is a breaking change** — GitHub previously applied `status:ready` on omission, so a caller that relied on that must now pass `build_ready: true`.
- **`build_ready: false`** → create the leaf **without** `status:ready`, so it sits in the backlog for a human to review and promote into the queue.
- **`build_ready: true`** → ensure the leaf carries `status:ready` so `lisa-intake` / `lisa-github-build-intake` auto-picks it up.

**A filing with neither is an incomplete handoff.** A leaf that is not build-ready must carry an explicit `human_gate: "<why a human must judge this first>"`; nothing in the ready lane means nothing ever claims it. When `human_gate` is supplied, stamp the hold on the issue so it is auditable — a visible line plus the verbatim marker:

```text
Held for a human product call: <reason>.
<!-- [lisa-human-gate] reason=<short-slug> -->
```

**Stamp both surfaces, not just the marker.** Also apply the configured `human_needed` marker
label (`github.labels.build.human_needed`, default `human-needed`) to the issue, via `gh issue edit`/`gh issue create --label`. The marker in the body and the label say the same thing,
and a filing that carries only one of them is a **half-armed gate**: sweeps that read the body
honour it, and sweeps that read labels do not. That is not hypothetical — the repair sweep that
normalizes items carrying no lifecycle label keys on the *absence* of `human_needed`, so a
marker-only hold was its population by construction and got promoted into the build queue (#3805).
The marker remains the authoritative declaration; the label is what makes the hold visible to a
person scanning a board and to any path that has not yet been routed through the shared reader.
If the label does not exist in the tracker, create it, or record that it could not be applied and
proceed — the marker still holds. Never file the label *instead of* the marker.

**Write a `reason=` the release can name.** The hold's reason is not decoration: a hold ends when a
`[lisa-human-gate-release]` comment repeating that same `reason=` is recorded on the item by an authorized human, and the
next intake sweep then takes the marker label off and puts the item back in the build-ready role on
its own. Matching is per-reason so that a hold declared *after* an earlier release is not born
discharged. A keyless hold is legal and is discharged by a keyless release; a hold whose reason is a
paragraph is legal and nobody will reproduce it. Prefer a short slug the person answering it can
retype. Do **not** instruct anyone to delete the marker from the description to lift the hold — the
only body write available is a whole-body replacement, so that asks them to rewrite the whole record
to clear one line, which is why answered holds accumulated instead of being lifted
(CodySwannGT/lisa#3852). The marker stays as history; the release is recorded beside it.

If a leaf arrives with `build_ready` omitted or `false` **and** no `human_gate`, do not create it: report the incomplete handoff and name both ways to resolve it (`build_ready: true`, or a `human_gate` reason). Containers are exempt — their state rolls up from children, so they need neither.

**The container exemption is executable, not prose.** It used to live only in the sentence above,
which meant the `block-direct-issue-create.sh` guard — the control that actually runs on the CLI
path — had no arm for it, and a container could satisfy that guard only by declaring a build-ready
role `leaf-only-lifecycle` forbids on it or a human gate it does not have. A container now declares
a **third** thing, and this skill already writes it: the canonical Target Backend Environment value
`None — container: state rolls up from children`, defined once by `derived-branch-plan`. The guard
reads that one string, so there is nothing for the skill and the guard to disagree about.

Two consequences for a container written from here. Render the Target Backend Environment section
with that exact value — an absent section reads as *underivable*, not exempt, and leaves the guard
nothing to read. And do not put a **by-design leaf type** (`type:Bug` / `type:Task` /
`type:Sub-task` / `type:Improvement`) on a filing carrying that declaration: an item cannot be a
container and a leaf at once, and the guard refuses the combination. `type:Story` and `type:Spike`
are not in that set, because `leaf-only-lifecycle`'s childless-parent exception makes them
leaf-or-container depending on child work.

## Phase 5.5 — Validate (Pre-write Gate)

Before any write, invoke `lisa-github-validate-issue` with the full proposed spec assembled from Phases 2 / 3 / 4 / 5. Pass it as a YAML block per the `lisa-github-validate-issue` schema, including `runtime_behavior_change`, `authenticated_surface`, and `artifacts_attached` flags so the right gates run.

`lisa-github-validate-issue` is the **single source of truth** for what makes a valid GitHub Issue in this pipeline — same gate definitions as `lisa-jira-validate-ticket`, translated to GitHub's data model. Do not re-implement gate logic here.

If the validator reports `FAIL`, do NOT proceed to Phase 6. Fix the spec and re-run validation. Never call `gh issue create` while the validator's verdict is FAIL.

## Phase 6 — Create or Update

### CREATE

1. Compose the body markdown from Phases 2/3/4 in a temp file (avoid quoting hell). Apply `status:ready` **only for a leaf work unit** per the Phase 5 leaf-only rule (`leaf-only-lifecycle`) — omit it for `Epic` / `Story` / `Spike` and any issue that has child work, **and** only when `build_ready` is explicitly `true` (a leaf with `build_ready` omitted or `false` is created without `status:ready`; see the Build-ready control input):
   ```bash
   # Leaf work unit (Bug / Task / Sub-task / Improvement with no children), build_ready: true:
   gh issue create \
     --repo <org>/<repo> \
     --title "<summary>" \
     --body-file /tmp/issue-body.md \
     --label "type:<type>" --label "status:ready" --label "priority:<priority>" \
     [--label "component:<name>" ...] [--milestone "<milestone>"] \
     [--assignee "<login>"]

   # Container (Epic / Story / Spike / any issue with child work), OR a leaf whose build_ready is
   # omitted or false (and which therefore carries an explicit human_gate):
   # identical, but WITHOUT --label "status:ready" — a container's state rolls up from children;
   # a human-gated leaf waits in the backlog for a human to promote it.
   gh issue create \
     --repo <org>/<repo> \
     --title "<summary>" \
     --body-file /tmp/issue-body.md \
     --label "type:<type>" --label "priority:<priority>" \
     [--label "component:<name>" ...] [--milestone "<milestone>"] \
     [--assignee "<login>"]
   ```
2. Capture the returned issue number.
3. **Link to parent sub-issue** (if non-Epic): use the GraphQL sub-issue API.

   Resolve the new issue's GraphQL node ID:
   ```bash
   child_id=$(gh api graphql -f query='query($org:String!,$repo:String!,$number:Int!){repository(owner:$org,name:$repo){issue(number:$number){id}}}' -F org=<org> -F repo=<repo> -F number=<new_number> --jq '.data.repository.issue.id')
   ```
   Resolve the parent issue's GraphQL node ID the same way. Then call:
   ```bash
   gh api graphql -f query='mutation($parentId:ID!,$childId:ID!){addSubIssue(input:{issueId:$parentId,subIssueId:$childId}){issue{number}subIssue{number}}}' -F parentId=$parent_id -F childId=$child_id
   ```
   If the GraphQL mutation isn't available on the repo (older GHES, sub-issues feature off), fall back to text linkage in the body (`Parent: #<parent>`) and surface a warning to the caller. Do NOT silently proceed without recording the parent.
4. Phase 4b relationship lines (`Blocks #...`, `Blocked by #...`, etc.) are already in the body. No separate API call is needed — `lisa-github-read-issue` parses them on read.
5. If the issue changes runtime behavior, invoke the `lisa-github-add-journey` skill to append the Validation Journey section.
6. If `github.projects.v2` is enabled, resolve the created issue's node id and invoke `lisa-github-project-v2` with `operation: ensure-item` and `content_node_id: <issue-node-id>`. This is membership coordination only — the GitHub Issue remains the lifecycle source of truth for labels, body, comments, and parentage.
   - `outcome: disabled` → continue normally; no shared Project is configured.
   - `outcome: reused` or `added` → continue normally; the issue is now present in the Project.
   - `outcome: warning` (`required: false`) → preserve the exact warning and continue the issue write as success.
   - `outcome: blocked` (`required: true`) → surface the exact failure and stop returning success; do not claim Project coordination succeeded silently.

### UPDATE

1. Re-read the current body via `gh issue view <number> --repo <org>/<repo> --json body --jq '.body'`. Edit only the sections being changed; preserve everything else verbatim, including any existing canonical managed `## Lisa Usage` section unless the caller intentionally supplied an updated canonical section. Use the shared `lisa-usage-accounting` serializer/merge path rather than freehand edits to ledger rows.
2. Apply the edit:
   ```bash
   gh issue edit <number> --repo <org>/<repo> --body-file /tmp/updated-body.md
   ```
3. Add labels: `gh issue edit <number> --add-label "<new-label>"`. Remove labels: `--remove-label`.
4. Add new relationship lines to `## Links` if needed. Existing links are not touched unless explicitly removed.
5. Re-resolve the live issue node id and invoke `lisa-github-project-v2` with `operation: ensure-item` so updates keep the issue present in the configured shared Project without duplicating membership writes. Branch on `disabled` / `added` / `reused` / `warning` / `blocked` exactly as in CREATE.

## Phase 7 — Verify

Call the `lisa-github-verify` skill on the resulting issue. `lisa-github-verify` re-fetches the issue and runs `lisa-github-validate-issue` against the live state — same gates as Phase 5.5, applied to what GitHub actually stored.

If it reports failures, fix them before returning.

## Phase 8 — Announce

Post a creation comment via `gh issue comment <number> --repo <org>/<repo> --body-file /tmp/announce.md` with:
- `[<repo>]` prefix when the issue is repo-scoped (Bug / Task / Sub-task).
- Who the issue is assigned to.
- The relationships set in Phase 4b (`Blocks`, `Blocked by`, `Relates to`) with links.
- Any remote PRs attached.

Skip on UPDATE when no material change was made.

## GitHub Issues data model

The mapping below is the single source of truth for how JIRA concepts translate to GitHub Issues. Mirror this in `lisa-github-validate-issue` and `lisa-github-read-issue` so the shape is symmetric.

| JIRA concept | GitHub Issues equivalent |
|---|---|

## Writing by a bespoke path (your own script, direct API or GraphQL)

Nothing here stops a consumer from writing to GitHub through `gh issue create` directly, the GitHub REST or GraphQL API, or your own script, and nothing should
try to — a script that owns the credential plumbing is often the only practical transport.
**The transport is not the gate.** A bespoke write path still owes both halves of the quality
gate this skill runs, and owes them explicitly, because no phase of this flow will ever run
for it.

A bespoke script's own read-back does not discharge either obligation. Re-reading the issue
and confirming GitHub stored what was sent **proves transport, not quality**: it shows the
fields round-tripped and says nothing about whether what was sent clears a single gate. An
agent that reads `VERIFIED` out of such a script has been told the issue was checked when it
was not. Measured once, on one issue, on 2026-09-03 (CodySwannGT/lisa#3663): a local
script's read-back was clean on every field, and the issue then failed gates S5, S9 and S18
when the validator was run against it by hand.

What a bespoke write path still owes — the same two checks, invoked by hand:

1. **Pre-write validate**, the obligation Phase 5.5 discharges here. Invoke `lisa-github-validate-issue` via
   the Skill tool with the proposed spec as a YAML block **before** writing. Never write on a
   `FAIL` verdict.
2. **Post-write verify**, the obligation Phase 7 discharges here. Invoke `lisa-github-verify` via the
   Skill tool with the identifier of the issue you just wrote — or `lisa-github-validate-issue` directly in
   identifier mode, which fetches and validates the live state. Never report success on a
   `FAIL` verdict.

Both run standalone against an existing live issue; `lisa-github-validate-issue` documents the copy-pasteable
invocation under its standalone entry point.

**Three outcomes, never two.** `PASS`, `FAIL` and *could not validate* are distinct results.
If the validator did not run to a verdict — the skill was unavailable, a credential was
missing, the issue could not be fetched — that is **not** a pass. Report it as unvalidated and
say why. Collapsing "could not validate" into "validated" is the same misreading as trusting
a read-back.

**These are skills, not scripts.** `lisa-github-validate-issue` and `lisa-github-verify` are plugin-resident and invoked
through the Skill tool. They are **not** expected to appear in any repository's `scripts/`
directory, and their absence from one is not evidence that the capability is missing —
searching the repository you happen to be standing in is the wrong search.

## Rules

- Never create a non-bug issue without a parent Epic / Story (sub-issue link).
- Never skip relationship discovery — both git history AND `gh issue list` searches must run; outcomes documented under `## Relationship Search`. "None found" is acceptable only when documented.
- Never create a Bug, Task, or Sub-task whose AC references work in a different repo. GitHub Issues already live in one repo; reject AC bullets that span others — split into per-repo issues under a shared Epic.
- Never include a runtime-behavior issue without a target backend environment, and never include an authenticated-surface issue without sign-in credentials.
- Never overwrite an issue body without reading the current version first.
- Preserve an existing canonical `## Lisa Usage` section on update; never append a second usage
  section or silently drop ledger rows.
- All writes go through this skill (or the `tracker-write` shim). Other vendor-neutral skills must NEVER call `gh issue create` directly.
- The gate logic lives in `lisa-github-validate-issue`, NOT here. This skill calls the validator at Phase 5.5 and Phase 7. When a gate needs to change, change it in `lisa-github-validate-issue`.
- Never bypass the sub-issue mutation by encoding the parent only in the body. The native sub-issue link is what `lisa-github-read-issue` and the GitHub UI use to render the hierarchy.
- When GitHub Project coordination is enabled, always delegate membership to `lisa-github-project-v2`; never inline separate ProjectV2 GraphQL from this skill.
