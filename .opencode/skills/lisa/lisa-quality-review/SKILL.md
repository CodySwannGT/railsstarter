# Quality Review

Review code quality for changed files. Explain all findings in plain English as if speaking to someone with no programming background.

## Review Checklist

For each changed file, evaluate:

1. **Correctness** -- Does the code do what the task says? Logic errors, off-by-one mistakes, missing edge cases?
2. **Coding philosophy** -- Immutability patterns (no `let`, no mutations, functional transformations)? Correct function structure (variables, side effects, return)?
3. **Test coverage** -- Tests present? Testing behavior, not implementation details? Edge cases covered?
4. **Documentation** -- JSDoc on new functions explaining "why"? Preambles on new files?
5. **Code clarity** -- Readable variable names? Unnecessary complexity? Could a new team member understand this?
6. **Design source** -- Read `designSource.enabled` in `.lisa.config.json` first. Only boolean `false` opts out: omit the design-source review step; do not request DESIGN-SOURCE markers, Figma nodes, or Figma access for this obligation. Record `SKIPPED: designSource.enabled=false` in the review. Absent, true, or invalid values keep enforcement enabled. When enabled, for UI surfaces, does each changed file say where its design came from? Run the deterministic gate rather than judging by eye:

   ```bash
   node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-.}/scripts/design-source-gate.mjs" --base=main --head=HEAD
   ```

   Exit 1 is a **Critical** finding under the `design-source-of-truth` rule -- the change is blocked until every UI surface either cites a Figma node (`DESIGN-SOURCE: <figma-url>`, the preferred fix -- sync it back) or carries the exception marker `DESIGN-SOURCE: none — not in Figma`. The gate fails closed: an unreadable file or an uncomputable diff is a FAIL, not a pass. Host design-system rules (`figma-design-system`, `design-system`, `use-the-design-library`, or the project's equivalent) stay authoritative about what to build; this checks only that the source is declared. If the gate script is absent, say so in the review rather than skipping silently.

7. **Design-value binding** -- Independently of the design-source opt-out, review the same surfaces against the `design-value-binding` rule — it asks the orthogonal question of whether each value is *bound* to what the design system publishes, not whether the source is declared. A literal in an axis the project publishes variables for is a **Critical** finding; the identical literal in an axis with no variable collection is correct and must not be flagged. Aesthetic disagreement is never a finding under this rule. Cite the rule; do not restate its conditions here.

## Output Format

Rank findings by severity:

### Critical (must fix before merge)
Broken logic or violates hard project rules.

### Warning (should fix)
Could cause problems later or reduce maintainability.

### Suggestion (nice to have)
Minor improvements, not blocking.

## Finding Format

For each finding:

- **What** -- Plain English description, no jargon
- **Why** -- What could go wrong? Concrete examples
- **Where** -- File path and line number
- **Fix** -- Specific, actionable suggestion

### Example

> **What:** The function changes the original list instead of creating a new one.
> **Why:** Other code using that list could see unexpected changes, causing hard-to-track bugs.
> **Where:** `src/utils/transform.ts:42`
> **Fix:** Use `[...items].sort()` instead of `items.sort()` to create a copy first.

## Rules

- Run `bun run test` to confirm tests pass
- Run the task's proof command to confirm the implementation works
- Never approve code with failing tests
- If no issues found, say so clearly -- do not invent problems
