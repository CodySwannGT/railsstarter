# Increase Test Coverage

Target threshold: $ARGUMENTS%

If no argument provided, prompt the user for a target.

## Step 1: Gather Requirements

1. **Find coverage config** (`.simplecov` or `spec/spec_helper.rb`)
2. **Run test suite with coverage** to get current state:
   ```bash
   status=0
   bundle exec rspec >rspec.log 2>&1 || status=$?
   tail -n 50 rspec.log; echo "exit=$status"
   ```
   The status is captured before the pipe, because a pipeline reports its LAST stage's exit code — `tail` always succeeds, so a failing run reads as `exit=0` (`falsifiable-checks`, pager-shadowed status). `|| status=$?` rather than `; status=$?`: under `set -e` the `;` form exits before the assignment, so the failure is never reported at all.
3. **Check SimpleCov output** in `coverage/index.html` or console output
4. **Identify the 20 files with lowest coverage**, noting:
   - File path
   - Current coverage % (lines, branches)
   - Which lines/branches are uncovered

## Step 2: Compile Brief and Delegate

Compile the gathered information into a structured brief:

```
Increase test coverage from [current]% to $ARGUMENTS%.

Files needing coverage (ordered by coverage gap):
1. [file] - [current]% coverage (target: $ARGUMENTS%)
   - Uncovered: [lines]
   - Missing branch coverage: [lines]
2. ...

Configuration: .simplecov, update minimum_coverage to $ARGUMENTS%

Verification: `bundle exec rspec` -> Expected: SimpleCov reports >= $ARGUMENTS% coverage
```

Invoke `/implement` with this brief to create the implementation plan.
