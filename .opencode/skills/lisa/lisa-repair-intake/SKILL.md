# Repair Intake: $ARGUMENTS

## Human-gate release authorization

A release requires a trusted human author, not just matching comment text. Follow
`ready-role-filing` — **Human-gate release authorization**: preserve tracker-supplied comment
author IDs and bot metadata, resolve `trustedHumanActorIds` only from an explicit user instruction
or existing human-authored trusted project policy, and pass it with structured `comments` to every
hold classifier, reconciliation, normalization and release planner. Never derive trust from the
comment body, a display name, the actor's own assertion, or an automation posting on its own behalf.
Missing policy, missing/unreadable author identity, raw body strings, untrusted actors and known bots
cannot discharge a hold. Keep the item held and report the missing authorization; do not silently
replace these inputs with an empty history or an inferred allowlist. Authorized matching releases
continue through the existing path and never override an independently declared caller hold.


Run one batch-**repair** cycle against the queue identified by `$ARGUMENTS`, or by merged GitHub
config when the queue is omitted and a GitHub source/tracker default is resolvable. Where `lisa-intake`
scans the `ready` role and moves work *forward*, repair-intake scans the **stuck and
close-out** roles and moves work *unstuck* or *fully closed*:

- **Stalled in-progress** — an item left in an in-progress role (build `claimed`, PRD
  `in_review`) whose processing cycle died. It is technically "being worked" but nothing is
  happening, so it sits ignored forever. (The vendor PRD intakes explicitly leave an errored PRD
  in `in_review` "for the human to investigate from there" — that orphan is exactly what this
  skill recovers.) For a stalled **build**, repair-intake first diagnoses *why* it stalled by
  inspecting its PRs and deploys. A PR that **already merged** is recovered by applying the env
  transition build-intake never got to (its merge gate left the item `claimed` when the merge landed
  after its agent returned) — no re-dispatch. A PR that is merely **behind its base** (`BEHIND`, no
  conflict) is **re-synced in place** with `gh pr update-branch` so the already-enabled auto-merge can
  finally land — a clean rebase needs no human, and leaving it stranded is the exact gap that lets an
  auto-merge PR sit unmerged forever. A **true merge conflict** is first given **one bounded in-place
  re-dispatch** to the build agent — whose `drive-pr-to-merge` fix-mode loop resolves conflicts — because
  a conflict, unlike a failing external check, is fixable by re-running the build; only a conflict that
  survives that single attempt (or that the agent says needs design input) becomes a fix ticket. The
  genuinely non-resolvable blockers — failing checks / unaddressed CodeRabbit or `CHANGES_REQUESTED`
  review / a failed deploy — get a build-ready leaf fix ticket with the item moved to `blocked` (blocked
  by that ticket) instead of blindly re-dispatching the agent, which would just churn against them.
- **Recoverable blocked** — an item in `blocked` whose blocker may now be gone. The blocker is
  one of three classes, and repair re-checks **all** of them, not just dependencies: (a) an
  `is blocked by` **dependency** has since closed; (b) a **validation / quality-gate self-block** —
  the item was bounced to `blocked` by its own pre-flight `verify`/`validate` gate (missing
  Validation Journey, Sign-in Required, Acceptance Criteria, etc.) with **no dependency at all**,
  and a human has since edited the item to add what the gate demanded; or (c) **clarifying
  questions answered** / an **ambiguity** research can now settle. A self-block (b) is the common
  one missed by dependency-only re-checks: nothing else is blocking it, so re-running the same gate
  against its current content is the only way to know it is now passable.
- **Terminal-open drift** — an item already carrying its true terminal lifecycle role (for
  example GitHub `status:done`) but still open/active in the provider's native state. The inverse
  also drifts on Linear: a leaf whose native `state` was auto-completed by a magic-word / branch-linkage
  merge into a **non-terminal** env (Linear completes on merge to any branch, unlike GitHub's
  default-branch-scoped close) while its derived `status:*` label is still intermediate — reconcile
  it back to active via `lisa-linear-sync` Phase 4b per `leaf-only-lifecycle`.
- **Rollup drift** — a parent/container item (Epic, Story, PRD, Linear Project, or equivalent)
  whose own lifecycle state does not match the roll-up of its children's states per
  `leaf-only-lifecycle`. This covers the *completed* case (all children terminal → close the parent
  out) **and** the *intermediate-env* case (all children shipped to an env like `On Stg`, but the
  parent never advanced — including a parent left stranded in a status it should never carry).
- **Stale-`ready` container** — a parent/container (open child work, or a childless
  **Epic**) wrongly carrying the build-ready role. This is a leaf-only-invariant violation
  the build-intake claim gate deliberately leaves for a human; repair-intake reconciles it by
  rolling the parent up from its children (with an audit note), so a container never sits in `ready`
  indefinitely.
- **Missing official ready-label drift** — a GitHub issue that is missing every configured Lisa
  lifecycle label. repair-intake classifies it as a PRD or build ticket and adds the configured
  `ready` label (`prd-ready` for a PRD, build `status:ready` for a ticket) so normal intake can see
  it; if the later intake/implement gate finds the item incomplete, it moves the item to `blocked`.
- **Missing native child link drift** — a GitHub parent (a `ticketed`/other open non-product-owned
  PRD, **or a build Epic/Story container**) whose children are discoverable — from the generated-work
  section/comment for a PRD, or from body parentage (`Parent: #<n>` / `Parent Epic: #<n>`) for a build
  container resolved via the documented hierarchy fallback — but whose native sub-issue list is missing
  one or more of those children. This is the common shape when children were created by an external
  generator (e.g. Codex) or an older write path that recorded parentage only in prose and never called
  `addSubIssue`. repair-intake replays the `prd-backlink` / `github-write-issue` native-linking contract
  and attaches the missing same-repo children idempotently, so rollup and the GitHub UI can rely on the
  native graph again.

This skill is the symmetric counterpart to `lisa-intake`. It reuses the same queue-detection,
the same agent-team orchestration, the same "don't ask, just run" confirmation policy, and the
same per-item surfaces the vendor intakes use (`lisa:<source>-to-tracker` dry-run for PRDs;
`lisa:<tracker>-agent` + the scanner's lifecycle transitions for build) — it differs in *which
roles it scans* and, for stalled/blocked work, *that it skips the claim step* (the item is already
claimed/blocked). Close-out candidates do not dispatch agents; they only reconcile terminal
lifecycle state with provider-native closure and rollup state.

## Public contract

```text
/lisa:repair-intake [<queue>] [intake_mode=prd|build|both] [build_queue=owner/repo] [stale_after=2h] [max_candidates=100] [force=true]
```

| Token | Meaning | Default |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `<queue>` | Same queue identifier `lisa-intake` accepts (see Source dispatch). Optional only when merged config resolves a GitHub source/tracker and identity; otherwise required. | merged GitHub default when resolvable |
| `intake_mode` | `prd` \| `build` \| `both`. Only meaningful for a GitHub `org/repo` (or bare `github`) that hosts both PRD and build label namespaces. `both` is unique to repair — a repair sweep usefully covers both lifecycles in one schedule. Absent → `both` when both namespaces exist, else whichever lifecycle exists. | `both` for dual GitHub queues; otherwise infer |
| `build_queue` | GitHub build scan target used with literal `github`, especially `intake_mode=both`. Explicit `owner/repo` or URL for a build-only invocation wins over this token; otherwise this wins over `github.queueRepo`. It never redirects the PRD scan. | `github.queueRepo`, then `github.org/github.repo` |
| `stale_after` | How long since the last state-changing transition into the in-progress role, or since the last human / PR-side forward-progress activity, before an in-progress item counts as stalled. Automation self-comments do not reset this clock. Accepts `24h`, `90m`, `2d`, or `0` (treat any in-progress item as stalled — manual recovery, also the only way to resume work on a provider that exposes no reliable timestamp). Overrides config. | `2h` |
| `max_candidates` | Cap on how many stuck/close-out candidates to enumerate and evaluate. Repair every materially actionable candidate within this bounded set, then stop. Overrides config. | `100` |
| `force` | `true` bypasses the loop-prevention backoff window (so a manual re-run re-attempts items even if their fingerprint is unchanged). It does **not** change the staleness rule — use `stale_after=0` for that. | `false` |

## Confirmation policy

Do NOT ask the caller whether to proceed. Once invoked, resolve the explicit or config-backed
queue and run the cycle to completion. The caller (a human at the CLI or a scheduled cron) has
already authorized the run by invoking the skill; re-prompting defeats the purpose of a
background repair sweep.

Specifically forbidden:

- Previewing projected scope (number of stuck items, projected re-dispatch count, write counts)
  and asking whether to continue.
- Offering A/B/C-style choices like "repair / skip / report-only" — the documented behavior IS
  the default.
- Pausing because many items are stuck, an item looks complex, or a repair is likely to land
  the item back in `blocked`. Returning an item to `blocked` with a current, accurate note is a
  valid outcome of the repair lifecycle, not a failure.
- Pausing because a re-dispatch looks expensive. The cost of one cycle is bounded by
  `max_candidates` and the actionable subset inside that cap; the cost of stalling a scheduled
  cron waiting on a human is unbounded.

The only legitimate reasons to stop early:

- Missing required input (no queue argument **and** no resolvable GitHub default, or missing
  project configuration). Surface the missing value and exit.
- The queue itself is misconfigured (Status property missing expected values, JIRA workflow
  can't reach required transitions). Surface and exit.
- No stuck/close-out candidates, or none actionable this cycle. Exit cleanly with the idle-case
  summary.

## Orchestration: thin dispatcher (no team of its own)

Repair-intake follows the same orchestration contract as `lisa-intake`: it creates NO agent team and spawns NO named teammates. It is a bounded scanner/dispatcher — resolve the queue, evaluate staleness, pick the actionable candidates, and run each repair in the current session.

The reasoning is the same as Intake's: a repair that resumes stalled build work may culminate in a team-first lifecycle skill (`lisa-implement`, `lisa-plan`), and those skills can only create their agent team from the lead session — a spawned teammate cannot add named teammates (Claude teams are flat), so pushing the repair into a subagent strands the lifecycle skill without its team and collapses it into a single inline worker. Therefore:

- **Scanning, staleness evaluation, and per-item repairs run inline in this session** (Bash / MCP / vendor skills via the Skill tool — `lisa-<source>-to-tracker` for a PRD, the `<tracker>-agent` workflow's gate skills for a build item).
- **Any repair that dispatches a lifecycle flow does so via the Skill tool in this same session — never an `Agent` spawn** — so the lifecycle skill's team-first preamble fires exactly as a direct invocation would.
- The only permissible `Agent` use is a bounded **anonymous** helper (`Agent` with `name` omitted) for scan-side legwork whose result returns directly to this session.

Codex: the same contract applies — run the scan inline in the root session and invoke any lifecycle skill there so it can `multi_agent_v1.spawn_agent` its own team; do not `spawn_agent` the lifecycle flow itself. Other runtimes: apply the same rule through their equivalent delegation surface; if the runtime has no team/subagent tooling at all, the lifecycle skill's own no-team fallback handles it.

If a teammate inside an existing team somehow invokes this skill (it is a session entry point, not a nested flow), do not scan or repair from there: return a structured `delegation-request` to the team lead asking it to run the repair cycle in the lead session, and surface the misrouting.

## Source dispatch

Detect the queue type from `$ARGUMENTS` using the **exact same detection and disambiguation
rules as `lisa-intake`** — read that skill's "Source dispatch" section for the authoritative
table; the detection is identical and only the per-item action changes (repair instead of
claim-and-advance). The essentials, inlined here so this skill is self-complete:

| If `$ARGUMENTS` is... | Queue / lifecycle | Source/tracker key | Candidates repaired |
|------------------------|-------------------|--------------------|----------------------|
| Notion **database** URL/ID | PRD (Notion) | source=notion | `in_review`, `blocked`, terminal/open PRDs, all-terminal generated-work rollups |
| Confluence **space** URL/key | PRD (Confluence) | source=confluence | `in_review`, `blocked`, terminal/open PRDs, all-terminal generated-work rollups |
| Confluence **parent page** URL/ID | PRD (Confluence, narrowed) | source=confluence | `in_review`, `blocked`, terminal/open PRDs, all-terminal generated-work rollups |
| Linear **workspace** URL, **team** URL/key, or literal `linear` | PRD (Linear) | source=linear | `in_review`, `blocked`, terminal/open PRDs, all-terminal generated-work rollups |
| GitHub **repo** URL / `org/repo` (PRD namespace) | PRD (GitHub) | source=github | `in_review`, `blocked`, terminal/open PRDs, missing PRD child links, all-terminal generated-work rollups |
| GitHub **repo** URL / `org/repo` with `tracker = github` (build namespace) | Build (GitHub) | tracker=github | `claimed`, `blocked`, terminal/open issues, parent rollups (intermediate-env + all-terminal), stale-`ready` containers |
| GitHub **repo** URL / `org/repo` with an open issue missing configured lifecycle labels | GitHub label normalization | per classified lifecycle | add configured `prd.ready` or build `ready` |
| Literal `github` or omitted GitHub repo when merged config resolves a GitHub source/tracker and identity | GitHub; PRD scans identity, build scans `build_queue` → merged `github.queueRepo` → identity; `both` runs those two lane-specific targets | per lifecycle | per lifecycle above, plus GitHub ready-label normalization |
| JIRA project key or full JQL | Build (JIRA) | tracker=jira | `claimed`, `blocked`, terminal/closure verification, parent rollups (intermediate-env + all-terminal), stale-`ready` containers |

Disambiguation (same as `lisa-intake`): a `notion.so`/`notion.site` URL → Notion; an Atlassian
`/wiki/spaces/<KEY>` URL → Confluence (with `/pages/<id>` → parent-page narrowing); a
`linear.app` workspace/team URL or literal `linear` → Linear; a `github.com` URL / `<org>/<repo>`
token / literal `github` → GitHub; a bare token matching the JIRA project-key regex → JIRA
(else try Confluence space, then Linear team); a string with JQL operators → JQL. **A single-item
URL is out of scope** — this skill is batch-only; repair one item by hand via `lisa-implement`
(build) or by re-running `lisa:<source>-to-tracker` (PRD).

For GitHub `intake_mode=build` (a build-only invocation), an explicit URL or `owner/repo` wins;
otherwise resolve `build_queue`, then local/global `github.queueRepo`, falling back to
`github.org/github.repo`. For `intake_mode=both`, the primary `<queue>` is the PRD identity/source
repo and `build_queue` controls the build lane, falling back through `github.queueRepo` to identity.
A short queueRepo is normalized to `github.org`. Thus `both` is a bounded split scan: PRD candidates
at the primary identity queue, build candidates at the resolved build queue, combined into one
summary. Never apply both lifecycle namespaces to the umbrella repo merely because
`github.queueRepo` is set. Repository identity remains distinct and continues to drive
`repo:<current>` filtering, writes, and automation names. If neither an explicit queue nor a
resolvable merged GitHub default exists, stop with the missing-input error.

Role names for every vendor are resolved from `.lisa.config.json` per the `config-resolution`
rule — never hardcode status/label strings. The relevant repair roles:

| Lifecycle | Vendor | In-progress role key | Blocked role key | Terminal / rollup role key |
|-----------|--------|----------------------|------------------|----------------------------|
| Build | JIRA | `jira.workflow.claimed` (`In Progress`) | `jira.workflow.blocked` (`Blocked`) | env-resolved `jira.workflow.done` |
| Build | GitHub | `github.labels.build.claimed` (`status:in-progress`) | `github.labels.build.blocked` (`status:blocked`) | env-resolved `github.labels.build.done` (`status:done`) |
| Build | Linear | `linear.workflow.claimed` (`In Progress`) | `linear.workflow.blocked` (`Blocked`) | env-resolved `linear.workflow.done` (`Done`) |
| PRD | Notion | `notion.values.in_review` (`In Review`) | `notion.values.blocked` (`Blocked`) | `notion.values.shipped` (`Shipped`) |
| PRD | GitHub | `github.labels.prd.in_review` (`prd-in-review`) | `github.labels.prd.blocked` (`prd-blocked`) | `github.labels.prd.shipped` (`prd-shipped`) |
| PRD | Linear | `linear.labels.prd.in_review` (`prd-in-review`) | `linear.labels.prd.blocked` (`prd-blocked`) | `linear.labels.prd.shipped` (`prd-shipped`) |
| PRD | Confluence | `confluence.parents.in_review` (page id) | `confluence.parents.blocked` (page id) | `confluence.parents.shipped` (page id) |

In addition to the lifecycle roles above, the build lifecycle defines the **`human_needed` marker** — an additive label (`jira.labels.human_needed` / `github.labels.build.human_needed` / `linear.labels.build.human_needed`, default `Human Needed` / `human-needed`) that rides alongside `blocked` when the block needs human-only input no agent or retry can supply (see `config-resolution` "Build markers"). repair-intake's interaction with the marker is asymmetric and is the whole point of the distinction below:

- The blocks repair-intake **itself writes** are the auto-recoverable kind — it files a build-ready fix ticket and moves the item `blocked` *blocked by that ticket*, expecting the next cycle to self-heal. Those are **not** `human_needed`; if such an item arrives carrying a `human_needed` marker **this skill applied on an earlier cycle**, repair-intake **clears** it (the block is no longer waiting on a human).
- **Never remove a `human_needed` marker this skill did not apply.** "Stale" is a judgment about the block's kind, not about who applied the marker or when — so without this rule an operator's deliberate hold, applied *after* correcting a wrong transition, is indistinguishable from a leftover the sweep is designed to clear, and gets swept. Establish provenance from the label event's actor (`rejection-detection` **Automation-reversal memory** reads the same surfaces); if provenance is not readable, **leave the marker in place**. Removing a human's hold is unrecoverable within the loop; leaving a stale one costs a cycle and is visible.
- **The one exception is a hold that has recorded its own discharge.** A `[lisa-human-gate-release]` comment naming the hold's `reason=` is not a guess about provenance — it is the hold's stated void condition, recorded on the item by the person who answered it. Clearing the marker there is not overriding a human's judgment; it is *enacting* it. That is the whole of the exception: no other reading of "this looks stale" reopens the question above, and an item whose release cannot be read stays held. See "Release the holds that have been answered" below (#3852).
- The marker is consulted **before **any** repair transition**, not only before Class C. Class C's hard stop is the strictest reading of it, but a marker that is honoured on one classification path and ignored on the other three is not a guard — and Class A, dependency clearing, is exactly the path an operator reverting a wrongly-cleared blocker is trying to protect. Read all comments and consult `classifyReadyCandidate` / `planHumanGateRelease` before treating the marker as active; a matching release discharges the historical body marker. Use the shared helpers for robust label and declaration matching, and leave unreadable releases held.
- The blocks the **vendor agent** writes when repair-intake re-dispatches it (its pre-flight gate) carry `human_needed` already — the agent owns that marker. repair-intake leaves it in place.

Resolve with the standard role-read pattern (local overrides global, default fallback):

```bash
read_role() {
  local path="$1" default="$2"
  local local_v global_v
  local_v=$(jq -r "${path} // empty" .lisa.config.local.json 2>/dev/null)
  global_v=$(jq -r "${path} // empty" .lisa.config.json 2>/dev/null)
  echo "${local_v:-${global_v:-$default}}"
}
# e.g. build/github:
CLAIMED=$(read_role '.github.labels.build.claimed' 'status:in-progress')
BLOCKED=$(read_role '.github.labels.build.blocked' 'status:blocked')
```

## Access layer (which surface does each write)

repair-intake stays vendor-neutral; concrete reads/writes go through the same layers the vendor
intakes use. Never call Atlassian MCP or `acli` directly — go through `lisa-atlassian-access`.

| Vendor | Reads (scan / comments / links) | Writes (transition / comment / close-out) | Re-dispatch / re-validate |
|--------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------|
| JIRA (build) | `lisa-atlassian-access` `search-issues` / `lisa-jira-read-ticket` | `lisa-atlassian-access` `transition` / `comment` | `lisa-jira-agent` |
| GitHub (build) | `gh issue list` / `gh issue view --json` / `gh pr list` / GraphQL sub-issues | `gh issue edit` (labels) / `gh issue comment` / `gh issue close --reason completed` | `lisa-github-agent` |
| Linear (build) | Linear MCP `list_issues` / `get_issue` / `list_comments` | Linear MCP `save_issue` (labels) / `save_comment` | `lisa-linear-agent` |
| Notion (PRD) | `lisa-notion-access` (`query`, page comments) | `lisa-notion-access` `write-page` (status) / page comment | `lisa-notion-to-tracker` (dry-run) |
| GitHub (PRD) | `gh issue list/view` (PRD labels) / GraphQL sub-issues / generated-work section | `gh issue edit` / `gh issue comment` / `gh issue close --reason completed` | `lisa-github-to-tracker` (dry-run) |
| Linear (PRD) | `lisa-linear-access` `list-projects` / `get-project` / `list-comments project_id` | `lisa-linear-access` `save-project` (labels) / `save-comment project_id` | `lisa-linear-to-tracker` (dry-run) |
| Confluence (PRD) | `lisa-atlassian-access` CQL | `lisa-atlassian-access` page `parentId` update / comment | `lisa-confluence-to-tracker` (dry-run) |

## Staleness model

An in-progress item (build `claimed`, PRD `in_review`) is **stalled** when the last
state-changing transition into the in-progress role, or the last human / PR-side forward-progress
activity after that transition, is older than the `stale_after` threshold. `blocked` items are NOT
gated on staleness — their repairability is judged on current blocker/answer state, not elapsed
time.

Automation self-comments are not forward progress and must not reset the staleness clock. Status
comments like `[claude-build-intake] PR remains open...`, `[codex-build-intake] Follow-up pushed...`,
or `[lisa-repair-intake] ...` may be useful audit notes, but they cannot make a claimed item fresh
forever. If a provider exposes a changelog/history surface, prefer the timestamp of the last
transition into the claimed/In-Progress role over the item's generic `updated` timestamp. When the
history surface is unavailable, ignore comments whose author/marker clearly belongs to Lisa or its
automation agents, and use the newest human comment/edit or PR-side progress event instead.

A build `claimed` leaf whose linked PR has **already merged** (`state == MERGED`) is likewise NOT
gated on staleness. A merged PR is a settled terminal state, not in-flight work: the only thing
missing is the env transition build-intake never applied (its merge gate left the item `claimed`
because the merge landed after its agent returned). The recovery is judged on PR merge state, not
elapsed time — and crucially **post-merge activity does not defer it**. A freshly-merged PR keeps
producing activity that the signal below would otherwise read as keep-alive (a queued/in-progress
release or deploy check-run, a post-merge CodeRabbit summary comment), so gating merged-PR recovery
on staleness strands a *completed* leaf in `claimed` for as long as that activity keeps the clock
warm — exactly the failure that leaves a shipped Sub-task showing `status:in-progress` for a day
while its parents roll up against it. Recover it regardless of recent activity (Build `claimed`
decision tree step 0, and the dedicated high-confidence ordering bucket).

### Threshold resolution

1. `$ARGUMENTS` `stale_after=<dur>` (one-off override) — always wins. Parse `Nh` / `Nm` / `Nd` /
   `0` into hours.
2. `.lisa.config.json` `intake.repair.staleAfterHours` (durable project default).
3. Built-in default: **2 hours**.

`stale_after=0` means "treat any in-progress item as stalled" — a manual full-recovery lever,
and the only way to resume work on a provider that exposes no reliable activity timestamp.

### Activity signal (state-change first, portable across vendors)

Compute the item's newest eligible activity timestamp from the highest-priority signal the vendor
exposes, and compare it to `now - stale_after`:

1. Provider-native status/label **transition** time into the in-progress role, when the provider
   exposes it cleanly (JIRA changelog transition to `claimed` / In Progress, GitHub label event,
   Linear state/label history, Notion/Confluence page move/status history).
2. Latest human lifecycle/progress **comment** or edit on the item (for Linear PRDs, the
   project's own comments via `list-comments project_id`, plus any legacy sentinel feedback
   issue for projects that predate project-level comments). Exclude automation self-comments and Lisa audit markers such as
   `[claude-build-intake]`, `[codex-build-intake]`, `[lisa-build-intake]`, and
   `[lisa-repair-intake]`.
3. For build items, latest **PR-side forward-progress activity** on the linked PR: newest commit,
   review, check-run,
   or PR comment.
4. Provider-native item `updatedAt` / `last_edited_time` / `updated` only when the provider cannot
   expose transition/comment authorship and the timestamp is not known to be driven by automation
   self-comments.

If ANY of these is newer than the threshold, the item is **active** → record it as `active` and
skip it (read-only). For build `claimed`, an open PR with recent commits/checks is active. For
PRD `in_review`, a recent comment or page edit is active.

Count only **forward-progress** signals as keep-alive: new commits, a review that was just
requested or posted, an in-progress/queued check run, a fresh progress comment. A **settled
blocker state** — a failing/errored check run, `CONFLICTING` mergeability, a `CHANGES_REQUESTED`
review, an unaddressed CodeRabbit/reviewer change request, or a failed deployment — is NOT
keep-alive activity: it does not reset the staleness clock. The clock runs from the last genuine
progress event, so a PR that has been sitting failed/conflicted/awaiting-changes for longer than
`stale_after` counts as stalled and is diagnosed below.

A **merged** linked PR is the same kind of non-keep-alive signal, in the other direction: the work
is settled and complete, so its post-merge check-runs and summary comments must NOT count as
keep-alive either. A build `claimed` leaf with a merged PR is recovered regardless of the staleness
clock (see the Staleness model note above and the dedicated ordering bucket); it is never recorded
`active` and skipped on the strength of post-merge activity.

If a provider cannot expose any reliable timestamp, do **not** auto-resume its in-progress
items unless the caller passed `stale_after=0`. (Dependency-cleared `blocked` repair still
proceeds — it is judged on blocker state, not time.)

## Repair decision tree

Apply per candidate. Continue through the ordered list until every candidate inside the
`max_candidates` cap has been evaluated. Each candidate may trigger a write (lifecycle transition,
native close/archive/complete, re-dispatch, or refreshed note), be recorded read-only, or be
recorded under Errors. Do not stop after the first write; the cap is the batch boundary.

**Before any lifecycle write on a candidate, classify it for `automation-reversal`** per
`rejection-detection` **Automation-reversal memory** — a role change this skill made that a human
then moved back. This runs once per candidate at the top of the walk, ahead of the branches below,
because it wraps every repair path rather than belonging to one: a reversed rollup reconciliation
involves no dependency link at all, and a reversed Class-B re-check is the same shape as a reversed
Class-A clearing. Detection is a pure read and `unknown` **never blocks the sweep** — an item whose
history or authorship cannot be read is judged by the normal rules below, treated as neither a
reversal nor a clearance. A candidate classified `automation-reversal` skips the branches below and
is handled per Loop prevention.

### Build `claimed` (stalled in-progress) → diagnose blocker, else resume in place

**First check for an already-merged PR — this check is NOT gated on staleness.** Read the item's
linked PR state before applying the staleness gate (see "Stuck-cause diagnosis" step 1–2 for
discovery). If `state == MERGED`, recover it immediately via step 0's merged-PR arm regardless of
elapsed time or recent post-merge activity (per the Staleness model's merged-PR exemption): a merged
PR is a completed leaf, and deferring it behind the staleness clock is what strands shipped work in
`claimed`.

Only if the PR is **not** merged does the staleness gate apply. Once it passes, **diagnose why it
stalled** by inspecting the item's PRs and deploys (see "Stuck-cause diagnosis" below). A stalled
build usually stalled for a concrete external reason, and re-dispatching the agent at it will not fix
a PR that cannot merge or a deploy that failed — it just churns.

0. **Diagnose PR & deploy state.** Run "Stuck-cause diagnosis" below. It resolves, in order:
   - **PR already merged** (checked first, staleness-exempt) → the build effectively completed; the
     vendor build-intake's merge gate left the item `claimed` because the merge landed after its agent
     returned. Do **not** re-dispatch or file anything — apply the scanner's post-agent env-resolved
     `claimed → done` transition directly (step 2 below, env-resolved), and record it. This is the
     recovery arm for build-intake leaving merged-but-unadvanced items in `claimed`.
   - **PR only behind its base (a needed rebase)** → mechanically resolvable, **not** a human blocker.
     Re-sync the branch in place so the already-enabled auto-merge can land (see diagnosis step 3).
     Keep the item `claimed`; a later cycle confirms the merge and transitions. Do **not** file a fix
     ticket for a clean rebase.
   - **A true merge conflict** → **not** an immediate fix ticket. A conflict is fixable by re-running
     the build, so attempt **one** in-place re-dispatch first (the resume sequence below; the vendor
     agent re-enters `drive-pr-to-merge` fix mode, which resolves conflicts). Only a conflict that
     survives that single attempt — the same conflicting head still `CONFLICTING` on a later cycle — or
     that the agent reports needs design input, falls through to the fix-ticket path (diagnosis step 5).
   - **A real external blocker re-running the build cannot fix** (failing checks / `CHANGES_REQUESTED` /
     unaddressed CodeRabbit; or a failed deploy) → **do not dispatch the agent**. File a build-ready leaf
     fix ticket for the blocker, move this item `claimed → blocked` with an `is blocked by` link to that
     ticket, and record it. The existing "Build `blocked` → unblock if cleared" path resumes this item on
     a later cycle once the fix ticket is terminal — a self-healing loop. Skip the resume steps below.

     **On Linear, READ the pair's existing relations before writing that link.** Reported measured
     twice: `issueRelationCreate` on a pair that already carries a `related` edge appears to CONVERT
     that edge rather than add a second one — the outgoing count did not grow — and the undo is not
     what it looks like, because deleting the new relation removes the link entirely instead of
     restoring the original. Full reversal is delete **plus re-create with the original type**
     (CodySwannGT/lisa#3605).

     So: fetch the pair's relations first. If any edge already exists between the two items, do
     **not** write — record the item under the run's escalations naming the existing edge and its
     type, and leave both alone. A fix ticket freshly filed by this same pass has no prior edge by
     construction, which is the ordinary case and stays a single write.

     This matters here more than anywhere else Lisa writes a relation: this pass runs unattended on a
     schedule, and `max_candidates` defaults to 100, so a converting write is not one lost edge but
     up to a hundred — none of them logged, because nothing read the prior state.

     **Marked UNVERIFIED, deliberately.** The conversion was observed against the raw GraphQL
     mutation, and confirming it on Lisa's own path means writing a relation to a live Linear
     workspace. That has not been done and must not be done to close this. The read costs one call
     and is correct whether or not the semantics are what they appear to be — which is the whole
     reason it is safe to adopt without settling the question.

If the PR is healthy in-flight and no blocker is found, the work simply died mid-flight — run the **same per-item sequence
the vendor build-intake runs**, skipping the claim transition (the item is already `claimed`):

1. Dispatch the item to the vendor agent — `lisa-jira-agent` / `lisa-github-agent` /
   `lisa-linear-agent` (matching the queue's tracker) — with the item ref. If repair-intake is
   running as a teammate rather than the lead/root agent, return a structured `delegation-request`
   to the lead instead of spawning that named peer yourself; only the lead can add named teammates
   in Claude's flat roster. This resumes the work in place, preserving its existing branch/PR and
   prior comments.
2. **On agent success**, apply the scanner's post-agent transition yourself: `claimed → done`,
   where `done` is **env-resolved** exactly as `lisa:<tracker>-build-intake` resolves it (per
   `config-resolution` env-keyed `done`: explicit `target_env` arg wins; else reverse-lookup the
   env from the resulting PR's base branch via `deploy.branches`; then **cap the resolved env by
   the promotion-completeness gate** — see "Promotion completeness" below; if `done` is a map and
   env is unresolvable, fail loudly — never guess). repair-intake owns this transition because it is
   standing in for the scanner that never got to finish it.
3. **On a surfaced blocker** (agent reports it cannot proceed), leave/move the item to `blocked`
   with a `[lisa-repair-intake]` note (see Loop prevention). When the surfaced blocker is something
   **only a human can supply** (credentials, access/permissions, a product or scoping decision), the
   item also carries the `human_needed` marker — the vendor agent's pre-flight gate applies it; if
   repair-intake makes the block transition itself for such a reason, it adds the marker too. (A
   block that another tracked ticket or retry will clear is *not* human-needed — that is the
   auto-recoverable fix-ticket path above.)

> Do **not** reset stalled in-progress items to `ready`. Reset throws away state, makes a
> partially-built item look freshly human-approved to the next `lisa-intake` claim, and forces a
> two-cycle recovery. Resume in place.

#### Stuck-cause diagnosis: PR & deploy blockers

Run this for every stalled `claimed` build item **before** considering an agent re-dispatch. The
goal is to distinguish "work died mid-flight, just resume it" from "work is blocked on a concrete
external state that resuming the agent cannot fix."

**1. Find the associated PR(s) and deploy(s).** From the item's linked PRs (GitHub: prefer the
native dev-link surface — `gh issue view <n> --json closedByPullRequestsReferences` — which lists
merged PRs that closed the issue, then `gh pr list --search <issue-ref> --state all`; JIRA:
dev-status / remote links; Linear: attachments and git-branch links) and the deploy(s) for the
resulting merge (the env-keyed `deploy.branches` mapping from `config-resolution`). The `--state all`
is load-bearing: `gh pr list --search` defaults to `--state open`, so a **merged** (closed) PR is
invisible on that surface — the exact state this recovery path exists to catch. A merged PR linked
only via search (no `Closes #` / native dev link) would otherwise never be discovered, and the leaf
would never recover. Read each PR with the vendor's native state, e.g. GitHub
`gh pr view <n> --json state,mergedAt,mergeable,mergeStateStatus,reviewDecision,statusCheckRollup,comments,reviews`.
For `reviews`, derive the effective set from the **latest non-dismissed review
per reviewer**, ordered by `submitted_at` then id. Never count the raw history:
an older approval does not satisfy a later `CHANGES_REQUESTED` review by the
same reviewer. Use the same paginated REST reduction documented by
`lisa-drive-pr-to-merge` when the `gh pr view` projection is incomplete.

**2. PR already merged → recover, don't re-dispatch.** If `state == MERGED`, the build is effectively
complete and the only thing missing is the env transition the build-intake never applied (its merge
gate left the item `claimed` because the merge landed after its agent returned). Do **not** re-dispatch
or file anything: apply the scanner's post-agent env-resolved `claimed → done` transition (the
resume-sequence step 2, env-resolved from the merged PR's base branch **and capped by the
promotion-completeness gate below**) and record it as a repair write.

**Run the gate before the write, never after.** The blocker path (step 4) assumes the item is still
`claimed`, so a deploy failure discovered *after* a lifecycle write has nowhere to go. Resolve every
rung first: if the rung's deploy concluded anything but `success`, write **nothing**, leave the item
`claimed`, and fall through to the blocker path; if it has not concluded, write nothing and leave it
`claimed` for a later cycle. Only a fully resolved gate result is ever written.

**3. PR only behind its base → re-sync in place (mechanical, not a blocker).** If the PR is clean but
behind its base — `mergeStateStatus == BEHIND` while `mergeable != CONFLICTING` and no required check
is failing — it does **not** need a human. This is exactly the case that strands a PR forever: GitHub
auto-merge will not advance a `BEHIND` branch on its own, so a PR opened with `--auto` sits unmerged
until something rebases it. Delegate this mechanical nudge + classification to the
`drive-pr-to-merge` skill in **report** mode — the single source of truth for the
"ensure auto-merge + re-sync a clean `BEHIND` branch" primitive — so this scanner does not
re-implement it:

```text
drive-pr-to-merge  pr=<n>  on_blocker=report
```

In report mode it ensures auto-merge is enabled and runs `gh pr update-branch <n>` only when the
PR is `BEHIND`-but-clean **and** the base branch's ruleset or classic branch protection requires
strict up-to-date status checks (`strict_required_status_checks_policy` / `required_status_checks.strict`).
If strict checks are off, it does not update the branch solely because the base moved; that avoids
CI cancellation storms in repos where updating the PR head restarts and cancels in-flight runs. It
never edits code, resolves threads, or dismisses reviews. It returns a classification (`merged` /
`will-merge-after-resync` / `blocked:<reason>`). On a `merged` / `will-merge-after-resync` result,
record this as a repair write (`resynced`), keep the item `claimed`, and move on — a later cycle sees
the now-`CLEAN` (or merged) PR and either lets auto-merge finish or applies the merged-PR recovery in
step 2. Only if `gh pr update-branch` itself reports a conflict it cannot apply does the PR become a
true conflict (step 4). Honor the backoff window so repeated cycles don't re-issue `update-branch` on
an unchanged head (Loop prevention). For JIRA/Linear items the PR is still the GitHub PR backing the
branch — operate on it the same way.

**4. Classify as a blocker.** Treat any of these as a real external blocker:

- **True merge conflict** — confirmed by a **merge trial**, never by a cached field.
  `mergeable = CONFLICTING` and `mergeStateStatus = DIRTY` are hints that say *go look*: both are
  computed asynchronously, and a stale one is served often enough that GitHub reported `DIRTY` for two
  branches at the same moment while only one of them actually conflicted (#3694). Re-derive from
  primary evidence at the moment of asking:

  ```sh
  base=$(gh pr view <pr> --json baseRefName --jq .baseRefName)
  head=$(gh pr view <pr> --json headRefOid --jq .headRefOid)
  git fetch --quiet origin "$base" "pull/<pr>/head" || readable=no
  git rev-parse --verify --quiet "origin/$base^{commit}" >/dev/null || readable=no
  git rev-parse --verify --quiet "$head^{commit}" >/dev/null || readable=no
  out=$(git merge-tree --write-tree "origin/$base" "$head" 2>/dev/null); code=$?
  ```

  `merge-tree --write-tree` merges into the object store only — no working tree, no index and no
  branch is touched — so it is safe inside an unattended scanner.

  **Read the exit code together with stdout; the exit code alone cannot separate the three states.**
  Measured on git 2.53.0: a trial naming a ref that does not exist exits `1`, the same code a genuine
  conflict returns, printing nothing on stdout and `merge-tree: <ref> - not something we can merge`
  on stderr. A trial that ran always prints the resulting tree OID on its first line; one that could
  not run prints nothing. Three states, and the third is not optional:

  - `code == 1` **and** `$out` non-empty → **CONFLICTED**. A real external blocker. Unlike the other
    classes below, a conflict is **resolvable by re-running the build**, so step 5 gives it one
    in-place re-dispatch before filing — see its conflict-first rule.
  - `code == 0` → **CLEAN**. Not a blocker, whatever the API said. Write nothing, leave the item
    `claimed`, and let a later cycle re-ask.
  - `readable=no`, `$out` empty, or any other exit → **NOT DETERMINED**. The trial could not run — an
    unresolvable ref, an unreachable remote, a git older than 2.38 — which is an absence of evidence,
    not a verdict. Write nothing, file nothing, leave the item `claimed`, and record it as
    `not_determined` in the run summary so a later cycle re-asks.

  A `gh pr update-branch` (step 3) that reported a conflict it cannot apply also counts as
  CONFLICTED — that is a merge actually attempted, not a cached answer. A merely `BEHIND` branch is
  **not** here — it was re-synced in step 3.

  **Filing on a cached field is the expensive direction here.** In a fix-mode loop a false
  CONFLICTED wastes a resolve, which a human sees; in this scanner it files a
  BLOCKER against a pull request that has nothing wrong with it, unattended — so the wrong answer
  becomes durable tracker state that a later cycle reads as fact, and intake will keep doing that
  without anyone noticing. Verify before filing, never after.
- **Failing required checks** — `statusCheckRollup` has a `FAILURE`/`ERROR`/`TIMED_OUT` conclusion,
  or `mergeStateStatus = UNSTABLE`/`BLOCKED` due to checks.
- **Change requests outstanding** — `reviewDecision = CHANGES_REQUESTED`, or unresolved CodeRabbit
  (or other reviewer) comments that request changes and have not been addressed by a newer commit.
- **Branch-protection / approvals blocked** — `mergeStateStatus = BLOCKED` for a reason other than
  a transient check still running.
- **Failed deploy** — the deployment for the item's merge/branch reports a failed/errored status
  (failed deploy workflow run, failed deployment status, or the project's deploy check is red).

A check that is still **queued/in progress**, or a `CLEAN`/`HAS_HOOKS` mergeable PR with no
outstanding change request, is **not** a blocker — that is normal in-flight state. (Such a PR with
recent check/commit activity would already have been caught as `active` by the staleness gate.)

**5. On a blocker found → file a leaf fix ticket + block the item.**

**Conflict-first exception (try to resolve before filing).** A *true merge conflict* — and only a
conflict, not failing checks, change requests, or a failed deploy — is fixable by re-running the build:
the vendor agent's `drive-pr-to-merge` fix-mode loop resolves conflicts. So before filing a fix ticket
for a conflict, give the item **one** in-place re-dispatch: run the resume-in-place sequence (steps 1–3
of the parent path above), which re-enters `drive-pr-to-merge` in fix mode against the existing PR.
Bound it to a single attempt per conflicting head — when you re-dispatch, post a `[lisa-repair-intake]
conflict-resolve-attempt: <item-ref>@<head-sha>` marker keyed on the PR head SHA. On a later cycle, if
that marker already exists for the **same** head SHA and the PR is still `CONFLICTING`, the attempt
failed: stop retrying and file the fix ticket below. File immediately (skip the attempt) if the agent
reports the conflict needs design input. Every other blocker class files the fix ticket with no
re-dispatch. Honor the backoff window / state fingerprint (Loop prevention) so the re-dispatch is never
re-issued against an unchanged conflicting head.

1. **File one build-ready leaf fix ticket** per distinct blocker via `lisa-tracker-write` (the
   vendor-neutral leaf writer + validation gate; never a vendor `*-write-*` skill directly),
   `issue_type: Bug` for a failing-check/conflict/failed-deploy, `Task` for review-feedback
   follow-up, `build_ready: true` so it auto-builds. The ticket MUST name: the blocked item + its
   PR/deploy URL, the exact blocker (conflict / which checks failed with their logs link / which
   change requests / which deploy run), three-audience description, and Gherkin acceptance criteria
   for "PR is mergeable / deploy is green." Every created blocker fix ticket MUST end with the
   `rejection-detection` **operator footer** as a visible prose line:
   `To stop this from being raised again, close it as **Not planned**. Close it as **Completed** if it was fixed — a later recurrence may be re-filed as a regression.`
2. **Transition the stalled item `claimed → blocked`** and add an **`is blocked by`** link to the
   new fix ticket (vendor-native: JIRA issue link `is blocked by`; GitHub/Linear `Blocked by:` line
   + label). Post a `[lisa-repair-intake]` note naming what it is blocked by and why. This block is
   **auto-recoverable** — the fix ticket will build and close on its own — so do **not** add the
   `human_needed` marker, and if the item carries a `human_needed` label **this skill applied on an
   earlier cycle**, remove it here (it is no longer waiting on a human). The `human_needed` marker
   is reserved for blocks a human must clear; this one a later cycle clears automatically.
   **A marker this skill did not apply is never removed here** — see the marker's provenance rule
   above. The block's kind says the *block* self-heals; it says nothing about why a human put a
   hold on the item, and an operator's hold applied after correcting a wrong transition looks
   identical to a leftover unless provenance is checked.
3. **Record it** as a repair write. Do **not** dispatch the vendor agent for this item this cycle.

The item now sits in `blocked`; once the fix ticket reaches a terminal state, the **Build
`blocked` → unblock if cleared** path (next section) detects the cleared `is blocked by`
dependency and resumes the original in place — a self-healing loop.

**Idempotency.** Before filing, check for a fix ticket already carrying the marker
`[lisa-repair-intake] blocker:<item-ref>/<blocker-key>` (blocker-key is a stable slug of the
blocker, e.g. `pr-1234/merge-conflict` or `pr-1234/checks-failing`). Per the `rejection-detection`
rule's **Proposal rejection memory** section, that marker search MUST cover **open AND closed**
tickets (body-enumeration fallback on search-index lag): an **open** match → reference it and ensure
the `is blocked by` link is present rather than creating a duplicate; a match **closed as _not
planned_** (GitHub `stateReason == "not_planned"`; the config-resolved equivalent on JIRA/Linear) is
a **human decline** of that fix ticket — do **not** re-file it without a materially changed consequence, requirement, or risk addressing the decline, supported by evidence that **postdates the
decline**, and the re-filed ticket MUST carry BOTH the machine token (`declined <date>; recurred
<date> in <ref>`) and the human acknowledgment sentence (`You declined this on <date>. New evidence (<date>, <ref>) changes the consequence, requirement, or risk: <what changed and why the decline no longer applies>.`); a match closed as
_completed_ is a regression path, not a decline. Honor the backoff window and state fingerprint
(Loop prevention) so re-runs over the same unchanged blocker are no-ops.

#### Promotion completeness: the base branch is not the delivery

A merged PR's base branch names the environment the change **entered**, not the environments it has
**reached**. A hotfix merged straight to `main` enters production out of order: the reverse-lookup
resolves `production`, `production` is terminal, and the item closes while `staging` has none of the
fix and cannot deploy. The evidence is real — merged PR, merge-commit ancestry in `main`, a green
production deploy — and the inference from it is still wrong.

So before writing any env-resolved `done`, walk `deploy.order` from its **lowest** rung and keep
rungs while they are **reached**, stopping at the first that is not. A rung is reached when both
hold for its `deploy.branches` branch:

- **Ancestry** — `git fetch origin <branch> && git merge-base --is-ancestor <merge-sha> origin/<branch>`,
  asserted for **every** env branch at or below the resolved env — never only the PR's base.
- **Deploy health** — that branch's most recent deploy **concluded `success`**. Read the
  `conclusion`, never the `status`: an in-flight deploy has a null conclusion and is
  indistinguishable from a pass on the status field alone. Only `success` promotes — a null
  conclusion and every other conclusion (`failure`, `cancelled`, `timed_out`, `neutral`, `skipped`,
  `stale`, `action_required`) leave the rung unreached. An unconcluded deploy is unknown, not green
  — do not write that rung this cycle; a later cycle reads a concluded run. Where a project exposes
  no deploy surface for a branch at all, ancestry alone decides that rung.

Write the highest **contiguously reached** rung at or below the resolved env — never a higher rung,
even when the higher rung is reached and a lower one is not. A merge present in `dev` and `main` but
absent from `staging` writes `dev` (`On Dev`), which is intermediate: the item stays natively open
and the promotion gap is what holds it open. When no rung is reached, write nothing and leave the
item in its current role.

The refusal is named, never silent. When the gate caps the env below the resolved one, the
`[lisa-repair-intake]` note MUST carry all three fields —
`<first unreached env> (<its branch>) — <condition>` — where the condition is exactly one of
`missing ancestry`, `deploy unknown: <run URL, or "no concluded run">` (an in-flight run, or a
branch with a deploy surface but nothing concluded), or
`deploy concluded <conclusion>: <run URL>`. A failing run named without its environment and branch,
or an environment named without its condition, is an incomplete note.

**Do not classify the gap away.** An open back-fill PR against a skipped environment branch is
*outstanding delivery*, not branch hygiene: it is the evidence that a rung was skipped, so it holds
the item open. Recording "the fix reached dev and production but skipped staging, so that PR is a
branch back-fill, not outstanding delivery" and then closing anyway is this defect exactly — the
condition observed, filed under the wrong heading, and overridden.

### Resolve the shipped blocker-edge module

The helper ships in the plugin and npm package. Only the runtime-supplied plugin roots
and installed package are trusted here; do not search arbitrary checkout-local plugin folders.
Write the evaluated edge inputs to a JSON array file, then call `blocker_edge_decisions`.
An absent module, unreadable input or import failure stops this repair without tracker writes.

```bash
resolve_blocker_guard() {
  local candidate
  for candidate in \
    "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:+$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/blocker-edge-resolution.mjs}" \
    "${PLUGIN_ROOT:+$PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/blocker-edge-resolution.mjs}" \
    node_modules/@codyswann/lisa/plugins/lisa/scripts/blocker-edge-resolution.mjs; do
    [ -n "$candidate" ] && [ -f "$candidate" ] && { printf '%s\n' "$candidate"; return; }
  done
  echo "Error: could not locate blocker-edge-resolution.mjs; refusing repair." >&2
  return 1
}

blocker_edge_decisions() {  # JSON array file -> decision object
  local guard
  guard=$(resolve_blocker_guard) || return 1
  node --input-type=module - "$guard" "$1" <<'LISA_BLOCKER_NODE'
import { readFileSync } from "node:fs";
import { resolve } from "node:path";
import { pathToFileURL } from "node:url";
const { resolveBlockerEdges } = await import(pathToFileURL(resolve(process.argv[2])).href);
const edges = JSON.parse(readFileSync(process.argv[3], "utf8"));
if (!Array.isArray(edges)) throw new Error("Expected an array of blocker edges");
console.log(JSON.stringify(resolveBlockerEdges(edges)));
LISA_BLOCKER_NODE
}
```

### Build `blocked` → re-evaluate, unblock if cleared

1. Read the block reason and classify the blocker (see Blocker classification & clearing). An item
   may be held by a **dependency**, by a **validation / quality-gate self-block**, by a
   **deployed / runtime verification failure**, by an **ambiguity**, or by more than one at once.
   Re-check **every** class present — do not stop at "no `is blocked by` links, therefore nothing
   to do." A self-block has zero dependencies by definition, yet is fully re-checkable.
2. **Dependency cleared** — decide each parsed `is blocked by` edge with
   the shipped plugin helper `scripts/blocker-edge-resolution.mjs`, feeding it the
   `blocker-containment` verdict plus the blocker's state and closure reason. This is a module,
   not a CLI and not a required host `scripts/` file. Resolve a trusted plugin/package path and
   invoke `resolveBlockerEdges` as shown above; never create a second resolver in the host.
   It returns `dissolve` / `keep` / `escalate` per edge.
   **Dissolve the edge in the SAME write that records the ruling, then read the relation back and
   confirm it is gone.** Only when the parsed edge set is non-empty and the resolver returns
   `proceed: true` with every edge dissolved → move `blocked → claimed`, then run the
   same agent-dispatch + post-agent `claimed → done` sequence as the stalled-`claimed` path above
   (one-cycle recovery). If the agent re-blocks, move back to `blocked` — a valid outcome.

   **Moving the state without removing the edge is not a clearance, it is a claim about one.** That
   was the defect (CodySwannGT/lisa#3472): the pass moved the state and left the relation, recording
   the ruling as a comment, and the next reader parses relations rather than prose — so the block
   re-formed every cycle and a human had to break the loop. Reading the relation back is what makes
   "I removed the link" distinguishable from "I meant to".

   **An `escalate` verdict holds the item and reports it — never dissolve on it.** The sharp case is
   a blocker closed `NOT PLANNED`: the work depended on will never be delivered, so dissolving reads
   as "unblocked" when nothing was built, and holding silently hides a decision only a human can
   make. Treating closure as satisfaction is the same reason-blind wrong write as
   CodySwannGT/lisa#3479. A single escalation among otherwise-dissolving edges holds the item.

   **On Linear, dissolve with a relation DELETE.** Do not "update" an edge:
   `issueRelationCreate` CONVERTS an existing relation rather than adding one
   (CodySwannGT/lisa#3605), so a writer reaching for it can destroy a different edge.
3. **Validation / quality-gate self-block re-check** — if the block reason is a pre-flight
   `verify`/`validate` gate failure (its `[lisa-*]` block note carries a gate marker + a "Missing
   requirements" list and there is **no** open `is blocked by` dependency), re-run the **same gate**
   against the item's **current** content via `lisa-tracker-validate` (read-only; the vendor-neutral
   gate `lisa:<tracker>-build-intake` and `lisa:<tracker>-write-*` already use). This is the build
   mirror of the PRD `blocked → re-validate` path below.
   - **PASS now** (the human added what was missing) → move `blocked → claimed` and resume exactly
     as in (2): agent-dispatch + post-agent `claimed → done`.
   - **Still FAIL** → stay `blocked`, but refresh the note with the **current** (usually smaller)
     missing-requirement set so the human sees what remains. Because the fingerprint includes the
     gate verdict + missing-requirement set (Loop prevention), a partial human fix changes the
     fingerprint and re-checks next cycle, while a truly-unchanged gate result stays in backoff.
4. **Deployed / runtime verification blocker re-check** — if the block reason is a failed
   *deployed* or *runtime* verification (a smoke/E2E/health check or manual probe against a live
   environment that errored — e.g. an authenticated endpoint returning 500, a deploy health check
   red, a seeded-data assertion failing), re-check by **reproducing the original failing check with
   the same context it used**: the same auth identity/credentials, the same target environment, the
   same route, and the same scope/parameters. A probe that does **not** exercise the failed path is
   **not** evidence the blocker cleared — an *anonymous* request to an *auth-gated* resource, a
   request against a different environment, or a narrower scope can all return a healthy status
   while the originally-failing path is still broken. (This exact false-negative — an unauthenticated
   `GET` to an auth-gated resource returning 200 without touching the failing table — wrongly unblocked
   a build item whose authenticated path was still 500ing, sending it `ready → claimed → blocked` again.)
   - **Reproduces clean now** (the *same* check that failed now passes) → move `blocked → claimed`
     and resume as in (2).
   - **Still failing** → stay `blocked`; refresh the note with the current observed result. Because
     the root cause is external (a deployed defect, not item content), prefer filing/keeping a
     build-ready fix ticket and an `is blocked by` link to it (the "real external blocker" path),
     so a later cycle self-heals when that ticket goes terminal.
   - **Cannot reproduce this cycle** (the agent lacks the credentials/env access to run the original
     check) → stay `blocked`; do **not** unblock on the absence of a reproduction. If the missing
     access is human-only, apply the `human_needed` marker. Never unblock a deployed-verification
     blocker on a weaker signal than the one that set it.
5. If the block was an **ambiguity** research can settle and no dependency remains → run the
   research needed (`lisa-codebase-research` / `lisa-product-walkthrough`); if resolved, proceed
   as in (2).
6. Else → still blocked. Refresh the note with the current reason (Loop prevention) and leave it
   `blocked`.

### Build terminal-open → native close / complete / resolve

For each build item that already carries the env-resolved true terminal `done` role but is still
native-open / active / unresolved:

1. Verify the item is a **leaf** or a **rollup parent whose all required children are terminal**.
   If it is a parent with incomplete children, do not close it; refresh a `[lisa-repair-intake]`
   note naming the incomplete child set.
2. Verify the terminal `done` role is the true final value per `leaf-only-lifecycle` and
   `config-resolution` env-keyed `done`. Intermediate env labels (for example `status:on-dev` or
   `status:on-stg`) are not terminal and must stay open.

   Verify too that the terminal role was **earned**, not merely worn: re-run the
   promotion-completeness gate (above) against the item's merge commit, and close **only** when the
   gate reports the terminal rung itself as reached. On a branch with a deploy surface that means
   `conclusion == success`; an in-flight run, or no concluded run at all, does **not** reach the
   rung and does **not** authorize closure. Where a branch exposes no deploy surface, ancestry alone
   decides it, exactly as the gate documents. If any env branch at or below the terminal one lacks
   the commit or fails its deploy-health test, do **not** close: demote the item to the highest
   contiguously reached rung, keep it open, and refresh a `[lisa-repair-intake]` note carrying the
   full refusal reason (env, branch, condition). A terminal label applied before the gate existed is
   exactly how an out-of-order hotfix reaches native closure — so the label alone is never
   sufficient evidence to close.
3. Perform the provider-native terminal action idempotently:
   - GitHub: `gh issue close <number> --repo <org>/<repo> --reason completed`.
   - Linear: move the issue to the configured Done / Completed native workflow state if available;
     otherwise record the missing native state as a setup error.
   - JIRA: verify it is resolved / closed (`statusCategory = Done`, resolution set if required);
     if not, transition through the configured terminal workflow path or report the missing setup.
4. Post a compact `[lisa-repair-intake]` note only when the native close-out changed state or when
   an actionable setup error must be surfaced. Do not spam already-closed terminal items.

### Lifecycle label contradicts native state — walk every direction

Use the existing detector to check native state and closure reason together.
`directionsWalked` reports all three repair directions:

| Label | Native state | Repair |
|---|---|---|
| Terminal `done` role | Open / active | Follow `Build terminal-open` above |
| Non-terminal lifecycle role | Closed as `COMPLETED` or reason absent | Advance to the configured terminal role |
| Non-terminal lifecycle role | Closed as `NOT_PLANNED` | Remove the stale role and add nothing |

**Build the classifier input inside this cycle. Never consume a temp file another skill wrote.**
repair-intake runs as its own cycle, so borrowing `lisa-github-build-intake`'s scratch file fails
two ways: absent, the redirect fails and `set -e` aborts the whole cycle; stale from an earlier run
on a *different* item, the resolver classifies that other item and this section reports `drifts: []`
while `directionsWalked` still claims both directions were walked. That is precisely the
silent-clean verdict this section promises cannot happen.

```bash
TRUST_DIR=$(mktemp -d)
trap 'rm -rf "$TRUST_DIR"' EXIT

# REST, not `gh issue view`: this payload carries `state_reason`, and the reason is
# what separates the two closed directions. A read that drops it makes a NOT_PLANNED
# closure indistinguishable from a completion at the exact moment one of them WRITES.
gh api "repos/<org>/<repo>/issues/<n>" > "$TRUST_DIR/issue.json"

# --paginate emits ONE ARRAY PER PAGE; --slurp + `add` flattens all of them so a
# label event on page two is not silently dropped.
gh api "repos/<org>/<repo>/issues/<n>/timeline?per_page=100" --paginate --slurp \
  > "$TRUST_DIR/pages.json"
jq 'add // []' "$TRUST_DIR/pages.json" > "$TRUST_DIR/timeline.json"

# Same resolution `read_role` uses: local overrides global, both optional.
# Resolving a stale terminal `done` here would make the true terminal label look
# like `open-label-closed-state` — and that direction WRITES.
jq -s '(.[0] // {}) * (.[1] // {})' \
  <(cat .lisa.config.json 2>/dev/null || echo '{}') \
  <(cat .lisa.config.local.json 2>/dev/null || echo '{}') \
  > "$TRUST_DIR/config.json"

jq -n --slurpfile i "$TRUST_DIR/issue.json" \
      --slurpfile t "$TRUST_DIR/timeline.json" \
      --slurpfile c "$TRUST_DIR/config.json" \
      '{issue: $i[0], timeline: $t[0], config: $c[0]}' \
  > "$TRUST_DIR/input.json"

node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/lifecycle-label-trust.mjs" < "$TRUST_DIR/input.json"
```

**Untrusted labels are excluded from `drifts` before any repair runs** — the classifier does this
itself, so repair must **never act on a label the classifier refused to believe**. Without it, a
bot-applied label on a natively closed item would be advanced to the terminal `done` role by the
`open-label-closed-state` repair, laundering the exact input the guard rejected into a real write.
The `excluded` array reports what was held back; surface it, do not repair it.

1. **`terminal-label-open-state`** → hand to the `Build terminal-open → native close` section above.
   Do not restate its rules; the terminality test lives there (intermediate env rungs like
   `status:on-dev` / `status:on-stg` are **not** terminal).
2. **`open-label-closed-state`** → the previously unowned direction. The item is natively closed as
   **completed** while still wearing a non-terminal lifecycle role. Advance the label to the
   env-resolved terminal `done` role and post one idempotent `[lisa-repair-intake]` note. This is a
   write on **Lisa's own** lifecycle surface, not a contest with another writer.
   Apply the leaf/container check from the **Lifecycle ownership guard** section *before* this
   branch: repair-intake owns container repair, so a natively-closed `ready` **leaf** is skipped
   here and left to the build lane rather than claimed by this pass.
3. **`open-label-abandoned-state`** → closed as **`NOT_PLANNED`**. Remove the stale
   non-terminal role and add nothing: declined work has not shipped. Post one idempotent
   `[lisa-repair-intake]` note naming the closure reason. This removal also applies to closed
   ready leaves, before the ordinary ready-leaf skip; it never claims or dispatches them.
4. **Vendor caveat — Linear.** On Linear the lifecycle surface is the native workflow **state**, not a
   `status:*` label (see `config-resolution`). A `status:*` label there is leftover cruft that no
   repair direction reads, which is precisely why TUN-556 and TUN-503 rotted. Treat Linear's native
   state as authoritative and remove the contradicting stale label; never move the state to match a
   label.

Membership in the lifecycle namespace is decided by the **`status:` prefix**, never a pinned member
list — the live family has drifted 7 → 6 members, and a literal set fails silently by simply not
matching the member it stopped covering.

### Bot-authored lifecycle label → distrust, never revert (read-only)

`status:*` labels written by a **bot** actor within the plausibility window of the item's creation are
not lifecycle signals — see `lisa-github-build-intake` Phase 2b for the measurement and the
classifier. Report them here so an operator can see how much of the board is wearing a label nobody
chose:

- list each item alongside the untrusted label, the bot login, and the latency, from the classifier's
  `untrusted` array;
- list `unknownProvenance` labels separately — trusted, but unattributable;
- **do not unlabel and do not relabel.** The bot re-applies on each subsequent review event, so a
  reverting reconciler produces a label-flap loop that is worse than the defect. Repair happens by
  intake declining to *believe* the label, which is idempotent and writes nothing.

This class is deliberately **read-only** and never counts toward the repair cap's actionable work.

### Build parent rollup reconciliation (intermediate-env or terminal close-out)

For each parent/container item (an Epic, a Linear Project, or any item — of any type — with open child work),
reconcile its lifecycle state with the roll-up of its children — **including the intermediate-env
case**, not only fully-terminal close-out. This is the recovery-side complement to the forward
rollup the `*-sync --rollup` skills perform; it catches a parent that was never rolled up (or was
left in a status it should not carry, including a stale build-ready `ready`).

1. Read the child set using the vendor-native hierarchy first (GitHub sub-issues, JIRA
   Epic/parent/sub-task hierarchy, Linear project/parent/sub-issues), with the same fallbacks the
   vendor read/sync skills document. **Record which children were resolved natively vs. only via the
   prose/body-parentage fallback** — the gap between the two sets is repairable native-link drift.
1a. **Heal native child links before rolling up (GitHub).** Whenever the resolved child set
   contains same-repo children that are *not* in the parent's native `subIssues` graph — the typical
   case when the children carry `Parent: #<n>` / `Parent Epic: #<n>` in prose but were never attached
   (external generators like Codex, or an older write path) — attach each missing same-repo child as a
   native sub-issue using the identical idempotent `addSubIssue` contract the "GitHub PRD missing child
   links" path documents below: dedupe by `owner/repo#number`, treat "already linked" as success, keep
   cross-repo/cross-vendor children documented-only with a warning, and on `subIssues`/`addSubIssue`
   unavailability record a capability warning and continue. A build parent attaches the children
   resolved by its hierarchy (its Stories/Sub-tasks), not only empty-parent-token top-level work — the
   PRD top-level-only restriction is a PRD rule, not a build one. Record repaired refs in the rollup
   state fingerprint so repeated cycles do not re-post. Do this even when step 2 derives `unchanged`:
   the native graph is what the GitHub UI rollup and progress bar depend on, independently of the
   parent's status.
2. **Compute the derived parent state** bottom-up per the `leaf-only-lifecycle` **Parent status
   rollup** state machine, evaluated over the env ladder `in-progress < dev < staging <
   production` (the ordered keys of the env-keyed `done` map): any required child blocked →
   `blocked`; else every required child shipped to some env → the **least-advanced** env among
   them (e.g. all `On Stg` → `On Stg`); else any child started → `claimed`; else unchanged.
   Optional / won't-do / not-planned children are terminal-but-dropped and do not hold the parent
   open.
2a. **When the derived state is `blocked`, classify the holds before writing anything.** A bare
   `blocked` on a container is a single bit, and it cannot tell a hold that waits on an external
   event from one that waits on a person rewriting an acceptance criterion — the second never
   clears on its own, so rendering them alike lets it accumulate silently (`leaf-only-lifecycle` →
   **Classifying a hold**; #3045). Feed the resolved child graph to the shared classifier:

```bash
ROLLUP_DIR="$(mktemp -d)"
# Serialize the EXACT graph resolved in step 1 before any classifier reads it.
# RESOLVED_CHILD_GRAPH_JSON is the in-memory object from that read; do not
# re-query the tracker here or hand-author a smaller substitute.
printf '%s\n' "$RESOLVED_CHILD_GRAPH_JSON" \
  | jq -e '{container, children, readError, renderedState, childTally}' \
  > "$ROLLUP_DIR/graph.json"
test -s "$ROLLUP_DIR/graph.json"

# children[]: { ref, state, labels[], blockedBy[{ref, open}], children[] } — the graph
# step 1 already resolved, nested as deep as it was read. The script probes nothing.
jq -n --slurpfile g "$ROLLUP_DIR/graph.json" \
      '{container: $g[0].container, children: $g[0].children, readError: $g[0].readError, renderedState: $g[0].renderedState, childTally: $g[0].childTally}' \
  > "$ROLLUP_DIR/input.json"

node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/rollup-blocker-classification.mjs" \
  --input="$ROLLUP_DIR/input.json" --since="<last recorded fingerprint>"
```

   It **exits non-zero and classifies nothing** when the tracker could not be read, the container
   has no children, or no child was readable. That is a repair failure to report, never an
   all-clear and a strict **no-write** result: do not transition lifecycle state and do not
   post/update the rollup note. Do not fall through to "no blocked children" on a non-zero exit. On success its
   report names, per class, the blocking leaf, the path to it, and **who must act** — those lines
   are what goes in the rollup note, verbatim. Never set the `spec_defect` marker yourself and
   never infer a class from prose; a hold with nothing recorded classifies `unknown`, and the
   report already asks a person to decide.

3. **If the derived state differs from the parent's current state, apply it** via the vendor's
   lifecycle write: a JIRA transition; a GitHub label swap in the item's own lifecycle namespace;
   or a Linear `save-issue lifecycle_role: <derived role> [env: <key>]` update, which resolves the
   configured workflow state in the access layer and writes that — never a lifecycle label, and
   never a state ID this skill picked. For GitHub, resolve the lane before writing: PRD parents use the configured `prd.*`
   roles, while build tickets use the configured build roles. Keep exactly one lifecycle label in
   that selected namespace and never substitute or overlap the other namespace. When applying any
   of these writes, remove conflicting stale lifecycle roles — **including a stale `ready`** the
   parent should never carry. Post an idempotent `[lisa-repair-intake]` rollup note naming the derived
   state and the child tally (honor the backoff window + fingerprint). Include that exact rendered
   state and tally in the classifier input: its fingerprint deduplicates the complete note, not only
   the blocker classes. **When the derived state is
   `blocked`, the note carries the classifier's per-class report** — the blocking leaf, its path,
   and its actor — so an operator never descends the tree by hand to find out which item and which
   kind. Use the classifier's `change.summary` as the dedupe test: an unchanged verdict has nothing
   new to say and the note is **not** re-posted.
4. **Perform native closure only at the true terminal `done`.** When — and only when — the derived
   env is the production/terminal value, finalize through the provider-native mechanism (GitHub
   `gh issue close --reason completed`, Linear move to Done state, JIRA resolved/closed verified at
   `statusCategory = Done`). An intermediate-env rollup (`On Dev`/`On Stg`) advances the parent's
   status but **must not** close it — it is still open per `leaf-only-lifecycle`.
5. If the derived state is `unchanged` (children exist but none started) or the required set is
   ambiguous / inaccessible, leave the parent as-is and record it as `active` or `still_blocked`
   with the current child tally; never guess a transition.

### PRD `in_review` (stalled in-progress) → re-run validate→route

After the staleness gate passes, run the **same dry-run validate→route pipeline the vendor PRD
intake runs per item**, targeted at this single PRD and **skipping the claim** (it is already
`in_review`):

1. Invoke `lisa:<source>-to-tracker` with `dry_run: true` and the PRD's URL (source = the queue's
   PRD vendor: `notion-to-tracker` / `confluence-to-tracker` / `linear-to-tracker` /
   `github-to-tracker`). This indirectly runs `lisa-tracker-source-artifacts`,
   `lisa-product-walkthrough`, and the `lisa-tracker-validate` gate, returning a structured
   PASS/FAIL report with `prd_anchor` snippets — the same report the PRD intake consumes.
2. **On PASS** → re-invoke `lisa:<source>-to-tracker` with `dry_run: false` to write the tickets
   (its full run already writes the PRD back-link via `lisa-prd-backlink`), run the
   `lisa-prd-ticket-coverage` audit as the PRD intake does, then transition the PRD to its
   `ticketed` role via the access layer.
3. **On FAIL** → post the clarifying-question comments grouped by `prd_anchor` (page-level for
   `prd_anchor: null`), tagged `[lisa-repair-intake]` (Loop prevention), and transition to
   `blocked`.

### PRD `blocked` → re-validate if new answers exist

1. Determine whether **new clarifying answers** exist: any comment/update on the PRD newer than
   the last `[lisa-repair-intake]` note or the original `blocked` note. For Linear include the project's own
   comments, anchored sub-issue comments, and any legacy sentinel feedback issue; for Confluence include inline/footer
   comments where the access layer exposes them; for Notion include page comments and
   `last_edited_time`.
2. If new answers exist → run the `lisa:<source>-to-tracker` dry-run validate→route pipeline as
   in PRD `in_review` above (skipping claim). PASS → `ticketed`; FAIL → refresh note, stay
   `blocked`.
3. If no new answers and no dependency change → leave `blocked` untouched (subject to the
   backoff window — do not re-post an identical note).

### PRD terminal-open → close / archive source artifact

For each PRD source artifact that already carries the configured terminal source role (`shipped`
for generated-work completion, or a source-specific terminal role that the configured PRD source
declares closed-out) but is still native-open / active:

1. Verify the PRD's generated top-level work is terminal per `prd-lifecycle-rollup`, unless the
   source artifact is already in a stronger product-owned terminal role that explicitly permits
   closure. Do not move a PRD out of `draft` or `verified`.
2. Close or archive through the source vendor's native mechanism where one exists:
   - GitHub: close the PRD issue with `--reason completed`.
   - Linear: archive/close the PRD project through Linear MCP when supported by the workspace.
   - Confluence/Notion: archive the page only when the access layer exposes a supported archival
     action; otherwise record a capability-aware no-op.
3. Never set `verified`; `/lisa:verify-prd` remains the only automated writer of the verified
   role. This path only reconciles an already-terminal PRD with native closure.

### PRD rollup with all generated work terminal → ship and close out

For each PRD in `ticketed` or another non-product-owned open PRD role whose generated top-level
work is fully terminal:

1. Read the generated top-level child set exactly as `prd-ticket-coverage` / the vendor PRD intake
   does: native PRD children where supported, plus the durable generated-work section fallback.
2. Evaluate terminal state using `prd-lifecycle-rollup`'s vendor predicate. A generated Epic or
   Story is terminal only when it has itself rolled up and closed out; do not re-derive its leaf
   descendants directly when its own state is still open.
3. Transition the PRD to the configured `shipped` role.
4. Close/archive the PRD source artifact through the vendor-native close-out mechanism where
   supported. This repair path is the explicit close-out sweep for PRDs whose child work is done;
   it does not set `verified` and does not run `/lisa:verify-prd`.
5. If generated work is missing, ambiguous, or partially incomplete, leave the PRD open and report
   the incomplete child set. Never close a PRD on partial completion.

### GitHub PRD missing child links → native sub-issue repair

For each open GitHub PRD in `ticketed` or another non-product-owned PRD role, compare the durable
generated-work fallback against the PRD's native sub-issue graph and repair missing native links.
This is the recovery counterpart to `lisa-prd-backlink`'s GitHub native parent-linking section:
PRD intake/backlink should attach generated top-level work as native PRD children when possible,
but repair-intake must heal the graph when that write was skipped, failed, or later drifted.

1. Read the generated work exactly as PRD rollup does:
   - Prefer the machine-readable `## Tickets` / `## Generated Work` section (`lisa:gw` tokens).
   - If the machine-readable section is absent but an older Lisa ticketing comment exists, parse only
     its structured `Top-level work:` block as a compatibility fallback. Do not scrape arbitrary
     prose.
2. Select only generated **top-level** work:
   - `lisa:gw` entries whose `parent` token is empty.
   - Older ticketing-comment entries under `Top-level work:`.
   Leaf Sub-tasks and descendant Stories are never direct PRD children.
3. Restrict native repair to same-repo GitHub issues. Cross-repo or cross-vendor generated work stays
   documented-only; record a warning instead of failing.
4. Read the PRD's existing native sub-issues with the same GraphQL `subIssues` query documented by
   `lisa-prd-backlink` / `lisa-github-read-issue`, and dedupe by child-ref
   (`owner/repo#number`).
5. For each missing same-repo top-level child, resolve node IDs and call the same GitHub GraphQL
   mutation as `prd-backlink`:

   ```graphql
   mutation($parentId:ID!,$childId:ID!){
     addSubIssue(input:{issueId:$parentId,subIssueId:$childId}){issue{number}subIssue{number}}
   }
   ```

   Treat "already linked" duplicate rejections as success. If `subIssues` / `addSubIssue` is
   unavailable, leave the documented generated-work fallback intact, record a capability warning, and
   continue.
6. Post one idempotent `[lisa-repair-intake]` note when a missing native PRD child link is repaired
   or when the native-link capability is unavailable. Include the generated top-level child set, the
   pre-existing native child set, and repaired child refs in the state fingerprint so repeated cycles
   do not spam comments.
7. Do not transition the PRD lifecycle merely because child links were repaired. Rollup/ship remains
   governed by the PRD rollup path after the child graph is complete.

### GitHub missing official ready-label normalization → configured ready

For GitHub queues, enumerate open issues that have **no configured Lisa lifecycle label** in the
active lifecycle namespace(s). This is the repair path for issues created by older tools or humans
with labels like `build-ready`, or with no Lisa status label at all, that are invisible to
`lisa-intake`, whose scanner only reads the configured `ready` labels.

1. Resolve configured lifecycle labels from `.lisa.config.json` / `.lisa.config.local.json`:
   - PRD lifecycle labels: `draft`, `ready`, `in_review`, `blocked`, `ticketed`, `shipped`,
     `verified` when configured.
   - Build lifecycle labels: `ready`, `claimed`, `blocked`, every env-resolved `done` value,
     intermediate status labels where configured, and `human_needed`.
2. Query open GitHub issues that are missing all configured lifecycle labels for the lifecycle(s)
   selected by `intake_mode`. If `intake_mode=prd`, only PRD-classified issues are normalized. If
   `intake_mode=build`, every non-PRD issue is normalized as a build ticket. If `intake_mode=both`,
   classify PRDs first and normalize all remaining issues as build tickets.
2a. **Ask whether a person is holding it, before anything else.** Call
   `planLabelNormalization({ labels, body, comments, trustedHumanActorIds, humanNeededLabel, lifecycleLabels, readyLabel })` from
   `scripts/intake-blocker-reprobe.mjs` for every candidate and apply exactly the verdict it
   returns. Do **not** re-implement the test here and do **not** decide held-ness from labels
   alone: the vendor writers stamp the `[lisa-human-gate]` marker into the body of a deliberate
   hold, and `human_needed` is one of the lifecycle labels this sweep keys on the **absence** of —
   so an item held exactly as the filing contract instructs is a member of this swept population by
   construction, and a label-only read promoted it into the build queue (#3805). The
   `[lisa-human-gate]` exclusion already existed in the read-only "Ungated non-ready filing" sweep
   below; the one sweep that writes was the one that could not see it.

   On `normalize: false` with reason `human-gate`, **stop for that item**: apply no label, do not
   classify it, and report it read-only per step 5. Writing a label here — even the human-needed
   marker — would turn a match into durable state on a second path, and the gate test is a plain
   substring match whose precision is a separate open defect (#3815). Refusing and reporting is
   the safe failure direction without the latch. Count these under `held_for_person`, never under
   `normalized_ready`.

   **Pass the item's `comments` with author identity and `trustedHumanActorIds`.** The planner reads a recorded `[lisa-human-gate-release]` comment
   as the discharge of the hold naming the same `reason=`, and an item read without its comments is
   an item whose discharge cannot be seen. That fails closed — it stays held — which is the safe
   direction and precisely why the omission is invisible.

2b. **Release the holds that have been answered.** This is step 2a's inverse and it is the reason
   this sweep is where it lives: applying a hold had a path and lifting one had none, so a person
   could supply exactly what a held item asked for, record the decision on the item, and the item
   stayed held forever (CodySwannGT/lisa#3852). The expensive part — getting a person's attention,
   framing the question, obtaining a judgment — was already paid for, and the system discarded the
   answer.

   Enumerate items carrying the configured `human_needed` marker **or** a `[lisa-human-gate]` marker
   in the body, and for each call
   `planHumanGateRelease({ labels, body, comments, trustedHumanActorIds, humanNeededLabel, readyLabel, lifecycleLabels, alreadyNotified })`
   from `scripts/intake-blocker-reprobe.mjs`. Apply exactly the actions it returns: remove the
   human-needed marker, add the configured build `ready` label back, and post
   `formatHumanGateReleaseNote()` once. Do **not** re-implement the discharge test, and do **not**
   decide it from labels alone — the hold and its release are body and comment surfaces.

   Three refusals make this safe to run on every cycle, and each one is in the planner rather than
   in this prose so it cannot drift:

   - **Still held plans nothing.** Every outstanding reason holds the whole item; an item whose
     second question is unanswered is not half-released.
   - **Never held plans nothing.** Without that this would be a path that adds the build-ready role
     to arbitrary items — a promotion mechanism wearing a release mechanism's name.
   - **An item that has moved on is not dragged back.** The ready role is restored only when the
     item carries no other configured lifecycle label.

   This is a genuine exception to "never remove a `human_needed` marker this skill did not apply",
   and the exception is narrow enough to state exactly: the release author must first be verified against `trustedHumanActorIds`; only then does the
   matching release satisfy the hold's stated void condition. The actor who originally applied the
   marker does not need to match that authorized release author. The general rule
   stands because "stale" is otherwise a judgment about the block's kind; here an authorized matching release is required; arbitrary matching text is not enough.

   **Never edit a description to clear a hold**, here or anywhere. The only body write this plugin
   has is a whole-body replacement, so deleting one line means rewriting the record and hoping
   nothing was dropped. That is why holds accumulated: each individual release was a small gamble
   with a large downside. The hold note stays in the body as history; the release is a comment
   beside it. Count these under `released_to_queue`, and name them in the cycle summary via
   `summarizeHumanGateReleases([...])` — printed even when it is zero, because a release path that
   has stopped working and a cycle with nothing to release read identically otherwise.
3. Classify the issue:
   - **PRD** if it has PRD labels/markers (`prd`, `type:PRD`, `kind:prd`), PRD structure
     (`## Problem`, `## Goals`, `## Validation Journey`, generated-work/backlink sections), or
     body/comment text that explicitly says `prd-ready`.
   - **Build ticket** if it has build work labels/types (`bug`, `type:Bug`, `task`, `type:Task`,
     `sub-task`, `type:Sub-task`, `improvement`, `type:Improvement`, `story`, `spike`) or
     body/comment text that explicitly says `build-ready`. When PRD signals are absent and the
     selected lifecycle includes build, default to **Build ticket** even if no build type label is
     present; build-intake/implement will validate the item and move it to `blocked` if required
     sections are missing.
   - **Ambiguous PRD/build** if strong PRD and build classifications both match. In `intake_mode=prd`
     normalize as PRD; in `intake_mode=build` normalize as build; in `intake_mode=both`, prefer PRD
     only when the body has PRD structure, otherwise build.
4. Apply exactly one configured ready label for the classified lifecycle — and only when step
   2a returned `normalize: true`; its `actions.addReadyLabel` is the label to apply, verbatim:
   - PRD → add the configured PRD `ready` label (default `prd-ready`).
   - Build ticket → add the configured build `ready` label (default `status:ready`).
   Keep any unofficial labels for auditability unless the project has explicitly configured one as a
   conflicting lifecycle label. Do not claim the item or dispatch an agent in the same repair cycle;
   normalization makes the next normal `lisa-intake` run pick it up.
5. Post one idempotent `[lisa-repair-intake]` note naming the classification and the configured label
   applied. Include the normalization result in the loop-prevention fingerprint so repeated repair
   cycles do not spam comments. For an item step 2a held, post `formatNormalizationHoldNote()`
   instead — it says that nothing was changed and how a person resumes the item, which is the
   opposite of what the reconciliation note says and must not be substituted for it. A promotion
   declined silently is invisible, which is the quieter version of the failure this step exists to
   prevent, so name every held item in the cycle summary via `summarizeHumanGateHolds([...])`. Report what the
   precision rule skipped beside it via `summarizeHumanGateMentions(n)`: the marker
   occurrences that were mentions rather than declarations (CodySwannGT/lisa#3815),
   because a rule that silently drops candidates reads like one that found none.

### Ungated non-ready filing → surface as an incomplete handoff (read-only)

The recovery net for the failure `ready-role-filing` prevents: an agent files a real defect it found
during other work, never gives it the ready role, and the ticket sits forever because build-intake
scans the ready lane and nothing else. Under that rule every filing declares either
`build_ready: true` or a `human_gate` reason; an item carrying neither is an **incomplete handoff**.

1. Enumerate open items filed recently (within the configured staleness window — same resolution as
   every other candidate class) that are **not** in the configured `ready` role for their lifecycle
   and are not in a claimed / blocked / terminal role either. On GitHub that is the absence of the
   configured build `ready` label; on JIRA and Linear it is a status/state outside the configured
   `ready` role. Items whose role is simply "the tracker's default created lane" are the target.
2. Exclude anything carrying the `[lisa-human-gate]` marker — those are deliberate holds and the rule
   ratifies them. Exclude containers (their state rolls up per `leaf-only-lifecycle`), and exclude
   `[lisa-exploratory-qa]`-marked findings, which are the rule's **named** human-gate exception even
   on an older item written before the marker existed.
3. **Report each survivor read-only; never promote it.** Name the item, when it was filed, and what
   filed it, and state the two ways to resolve it — flip it to the configured `ready` role, or mark
   it as a deliberate human gate. A filing whose readiness nobody declared is exactly the input the
   gate model says a human should see, so guessing "it was probably meant to be ready" would
   re-introduce the accidental-queue-entry failure this rule exists to eliminate.
4. Post at most one idempotent `[lisa-repair-intake]` note per item and include the finding in the
   loop-prevention fingerprint so repeated cycles do not spam.

This is distinct from the GitHub label-normalization repair above, which targets items carrying **no
Lisa lifecycle label at all** (created by older tools or by hand) and does normalize them. This sweep
targets items inside the Lisa lifecycle whose readiness was never declared.

## Blocker classification & clearing (conservative, vendor-specific extraction)

A `blocked` build item is held by one or more of three blocker classes. Identify which are present
from the item's block note(s) and links, then clear-check **each present class** — an item with no
dependency is not automatically un-actionable; it may be a self-block that now passes.

### Class A — dependency blockers

`lisa-tracker-read` is a thin dispatcher that returns each vendor's bundle **verbatim** — there
is no normalized `is blocked by` field. Read the bundle, then extract blockers per vendor:

- **GitHub**: parse the durable forms `lisa-github-build-intake` documents — `Blocked by: #123`,
  qualified cross-repo refs (`owner/repo#123`), issue URLs in the body/comments — plus timeline
  cross-reference events.
- **JIRA**: inspect the native issue-link records `lisa-jira-read-ticket` returns and select the
  `is blocked by` link type.
- **Linear**: inspect the native issue **relations** from Linear MCP `get_issue` and select
  blocker relations.

Then classify each blocker **by containment, per the `blocker-containment` rule** — cite that
slug for the full contract; do not restate its resolution steps or its fail-closed table here.

The one question is whether the blocker's code is on the branch **this item** will be built from:
resolve this item's base branch from its `## Target Backend Environment` through
`.lisa.config.json` `deploy.branches` (`derived-branch-plan`, `config-resolution` — never by
reading a rendered `Branch Plan`), resolve the blocker's merge commit through the vendor access
layer, and test ancestry against the remote.

- **Contained** — every merged PR on the blocker is an ancestor of this item's base branch →
  **cleared**.
- **Not contained**, or containment **not computable** for any reason the rule enumerates (no
  linked PR, PR not merged, blocker inaccessible, base branch underivable or absent from the
  remote, ancestry query errored) → **still blocking**, with the rule's reason key in the run
  record.
- **Ships no code** — the blocker is closed as completed, positively declares
  `## Target Backend Environment` reading `None — no runtime behavior change: <kind>`
  with kind `doc-only`, `config-only`, or `type-only`, and has no linked PR and no merge commit →
  **cleared** under the rule's carve-out. This is a positive determination, never an absence:
  "no PR found" is `no-pr` and stays blocking. A missing kind does not qualify; any linked
  open or unmerged PR stays blocking under the normal containment test.
- **Human override** — an explicit human statement on this item that the dependency is satisfied
  clears it and outranks a failed containment check. Name it in the run record.
- **Human hold** — the override runs in both directions. `human_needed` is checked here as well as
  in Class C: an item carrying it is left `blocked` and recorded `skipped: human_needed`, without
  running the containment check. Class A is the path an operator reverting a wrongly-cleared
  blocker is protecting, so a marker honoured only on Class C is not honoured where it is most
  often meant. Match it robustly (hyphen/underscore, case-insensitive, label set and note prose).
  Symmetrically, an explicit human statement that the dependency is **not** satisfied keeps the
  item blocked and outranks a *passing* containment check — the contract has an input channel for
  "you may now proceed" and it needs one for "your reasoning was wrong".

**A lifecycle status name is never the test.** `done`, `on-stg`, `on-dev` and `code-review` are
labels that correlate with containment in a single-trunk workflow and come apart from it in a
promotion workflow, where `main` is the trailing branch — a blocker at `On Stg` is on `staging`
and absent from `main`, and a blocker in `Code Review` is merged to nothing. Containment gets
both the loose and the strict failure right at once: a blocker merged into the branch this item
builds from clears **immediately**, with no wait for production, so a dependent is never stranded
behind work already merged where it needs it.

Only re-dispatch when **every** parsed blocker is cleared. When in doubt, stay blocked — a
false-negative (left blocked) costs one cycle and is visible; a false-positive is **invisible**,
because the item moves to `ready`, which looks exactly like a repair that worked, and the failure
surfaces days later as work begun before its dependency existed.

### Class B — validation / quality-gate self-block

A self-block has **no** `is blocked by` dependency: the build-intake/agent flow claimed the item,
its pre-flight `verify`/`validate` gate failed (missing Validation Journey, Sign-in Required,
Target Backend Environment, Repository, Out of Scope, Evidence manifest, weak Acceptance Criteria,
etc.), and the item was bounced to `blocked` carrying that gate's `[lisa-*]` note + "Missing
requirements" list. Detect it by: (1) the block note bears a known gate marker (e.g.
`Pre-flight verify gate: BLOCKED`, `jira-verify` / `*-validate-*`), **and** (2) there is no open
`is blocked by` dependency. (If both a dependency and a self-block are present, clear the
dependency via Class A first; the self-block re-check still gates the eventual re-dispatch.)

Clear-check by **re-running the same gate against current content** — `lisa-tracker-validate`
(read-only; never writes), which dispatches to `lisa:<tracker>-validate-*` exactly as the write
path and build-intake do, so the bar cannot drift:

- **PASS** → cleared. Proceed to re-dispatch (decision tree step 2).
- **FAIL** → still self-blocked. Refresh the note with the current missing set (Loop prevention).

Conservative, same as Class A: a still-failing gate is a real blocker — never re-dispatch a build
whose own gate has not yet passed. This is intentionally symmetric with the PRD `blocked →
re-validate` path: PRDs re-run their dry-run `validate→route` when source content changes; builds
re-run `tracker-validate` when item content changes. The asymmetry where build `blocked` checked
only dependencies — leaving verify-gate self-blocks stranded forever after a human filled in the
missing sections — is the gap this class closes.

### Class C — ambiguity / clarifying answers

A block that research or a human answer can settle (no dependency, no failing gate). Re-check by
running the needed research (`lisa-codebase-research` / `lisa-product-walkthrough`) or detecting a
human comment/edit newer than the last `[lisa-repair-intake]` note. Resolved → proceed to
re-dispatch; else stay blocked.

**`human_needed` hard-stops this path. Do not enter Class C at all.** Before classifying a block as
Class C, check the marker: if the item carries `human_needed`, skip it, leave it `blocked`, and
record the skip reason in the run record (`skipped: human_needed`). This is a **refusal to
re-evaluate**, not a preserve-and-proceed — preserving the marker while overriding what it guards is
not a guard. The marker means a human must decide; no amount of research substitutes for a decision
that has not been made.

Match the marker **robustly**: the configured label resolves to `human-needed` (hyphen) while the
contract term is `human_needed` (underscore), and it can also appear in the block note's prose. Treat
hyphen and underscore as the same marker, case-insensitively, in both the label set and the note. A
literal single-spelling match silently defeats this guard.

**"No blocker found" is inconclusive, never clearance.** Research that finds nothing does **not**
satisfy the resolution condition. Absence of a tracked blocker is not evidence that the blocker is
gone — it is frequently evidence that the blocker was never the kind of thing a dependency link
records. An item whose research terminates in "nothing found" stays `blocked`. Only a positive
finding — the research answered the open question, or a human comment/edit newer than the last
`[lisa-repair-intake]` note supplied the answer — clears it.

**Distinguish a decision-block from an ambiguity-block.** Class C applies only where a *discoverable
fact* would settle the question. A block awaiting a **choice between valid alternatives** is not a
researchable ambiguity at any confidence level, and research against it is structurally incapable of
reaching the right answer: there is nothing to find, so it terminates in "no blocker found" — which,
before this guard, the next step read as clearance. If the blocker names two or more technically
valid options and asks which to take, it is a decision-block: leave it `blocked`, ensure the
`human_needed` marker is present, and do not research it.

> Two conditions make a decision-block look exactly like a Class-C candidate: **no dependency links**
> (the blocker is a question, not a tracked ticket) and **no failed validation gate** (it is prose, not
> a red check). Together they read as "no blockers tracked, ambiguity present, go research it" —
> precisely the Class-C trigger, and precisely when the guard above must fire instead.

### Class D — deployed / runtime verification failure

A block set by a *deployed* or *runtime* check that failed against a live environment — a
smoke/E2E/health probe or manual reproduction that returned an error (an authenticated endpoint
500ing, a deploy health check red, a seeded-data assertion failing). This is neither a dependency
nor a content gate: the item is correct but the environment it must verify against is broken.

Clear-check by **reproducing the original failing check with the same context that set it** — same
auth identity/credentials, same environment, same route, same scope. The cardinal rule: **never
unblock on a probe weaker than the one that set the block.** A signal that does not exercise the
failed path is not a clear:

- Anonymous/unauthenticated request to an **auth-gated** resource (it can short-circuit to a
  healthy response without touching the failing code path).
- A request against a **different environment** than the one that failed.
- A **narrower scope** than the failing check (a subset that happens to pass).

Conservative, same as the other classes: reproduces-clean → cleared; still-failing or
not-reproducible-this-cycle → stay blocked. Because the cause is external (a deployed defect, not
item content), the durable handling is the **real external blocker** path — file/keep a build-ready
fix ticket for the deployed defect and `is blocked by`-link the item to it, so a later cycle
self-heals when that ticket is terminal. If reproducing the check needs human-only access the agent
lacks, apply `human_needed`.

## Loop prevention

A `blocked` item with a permanently unresolved problem must not be "repaired" and re-noted every
cron tick.

- Every note this skill writes is prefixed `[lisa-repair-intake]` and carries a compact **state
  fingerprint**: the lifecycle role, the set of blocker refs + their observed states, the
  validation verdict (PASS/FAIL) **plus the current missing-requirement set for a Class-B
  self-block** (so a human filling in one of several missing sections changes the fingerprint and
  triggers a re-check next cycle, rather than being suppressed as a no-op), terminal/open state,
  rollup child tally, and a timestamp.
- The fingerprint also carries **authorship and an overturn bit**: the actor class of the most
  recent lifecycle role change (`automation` / `human` / `unknown`), and whether that change
  **reversed** a transition this skill made — the `automation-reversal` classification from
  `rejection-detection` **Automation-reversal memory**. Without these the fingerprint records only
  *what* the state is, never *who* set it or *whether the last automated decision was overturned*,
  and those are the only fields that separate "the world moved on" from "a human told me I was
  wrong".
- Before writing a note or re-attempting a `blocked` item, compute the current fingerprint. If
  an identical fingerprint was already posted within the **backoff window**, skip the item
  silently (record as `still_blocked` / `active`, no write).
- Backoff window default = `stale_after` (2h). `force=true` bypasses backoff for a manual run.
- A *changed* fingerprint (new blocker state, new answers, new verdict) warrants a fresh note +
  re-attempt — backoff suppresses only no-op repeats.
- **A change whose only cause is a human overturn is not a warrant.** Where the overturn bit is
  set and no evidence postdates the reversal, the changed fingerprint is **not on its own a
  warrant** to re-attempt: do not re-apply the reversed classification, leave the item where the
  human put it, ensure `human_needed`, and record the outcome naming the **reversed transition**
  and the classification that produced it. Re-attempt only on evidence postdating the reversal —
  a blocker state change or a human comment supplying what was missing — cited in the run record.
  Without this qualifier the revert *itself* changes the fingerprint and releases backoff, so the
  faster a reviewer corrects a wrong transition, the sooner it returns.
- **This inversion is signed per path.** It applies to the paths that decide whether to re-make a
  lifecycle transition — Class A/B/C/D clearing and rollup reconciliation. It does **not** touch
  the staleness model: there a human comment counts as forward progress and resets the staleness
  clock, so an objecting comment already makes the item look active and this skill leaves it
  alone. That reading is protective; a single global "human activity no longer counts" would
  switch it off while reading like a tightening.

## Lifecycle ownership guard

repair-intake owns the repair surfaces needed to recover stuck work and close-out drift:
build `claimed` / `blocked`, PRD `in_review` / `blocked`, terminal-labeled native-open items,
parent/container rollups (intermediate-env *and* fully-terminal), and stale-`ready` containers.
It MAY:

- Apply the build scanner's post-agent `claimed → done` on a successful resume (it is finishing
  the scanner's interrupted job), and move a dependency-cleared build item `blocked → claimed`.
- Manage the `human_needed` marker on build blocks: leave it where the vendor agent set it (a
  human-only pre-flight block), and **clear** it from an item it moves to an auto-recoverable
  `blocked` (blocked by a build-ready fix ticket) — that block self-heals and is not waiting on a
  human.
- Move a re-validated PRD `in_review`/`blocked → ticketed` (PASS) or `→ blocked` (FAIL), exactly
  as the PRD intake does.
- Close / complete / resolve build items that already carry the true terminal `done` role but are
  still natively open, per `leaf-only-lifecycle`.
- Roll up a parent/container to its derived state per the `leaf-only-lifecycle` state machine —
  **including an intermediate env value** (`On Dev`/`On Stg`) when all required children have
  reached that env — and close/complete/resolve it **only** when the derived env is the true
  terminal `done`.
- Reconcile a **container** wrongly carrying the build-ready `ready` role (a leaf-only-invariant
  violation) by rolling it up from its children and removing the `ready`, with a
  `[lisa-repair-intake]` audit note.
- Remove stale lifecycle labels from a natively closed `NOT_PLANNED` item, including a ready
  leaf. Add no done label and do not claim or dispatch it.
- Move a PRD with fully terminal generated work to `shipped` and close/archive the source artifact
  where the source vendor supports native close-out, per `prd-lifecycle-rollup`.
- Repair missing native GitHub child links by replaying the same-repo, idempotent `addSubIssue`
  contract — for a **PRD** from the generated-work fallback (top-level-only), and for a **build
  Epic/Story container** from its hierarchy/body-parentage children — so rollup and the GitHub UI can
  rely on the native graph. This repairs structure only; it does not ship, transition, or verify the
  parent.
- Leave a normalization candidate untouched and report it when it is held for a person — the
  human gate is consulted before classification and its refusal is absolute.
- Normalize a GitHub issue with no configured lifecycle label by adding the configured PRD or build
  `ready` label after classifying the issue. This is a visibility repair, not a claim; the item
  remains open and unclaimed for normal intake.

It MUST NOT:

- Move a PRD out of `draft` or `verified` (those are product-owned), or set `verified` itself.
- Link leaf Sub-tasks or descendant Stories directly under a PRD. Only generated top-level work
  (empty parent token / `Top-level work:` entries) may become PRD children.
- Apply a build `done` value other than via the env-resolution rules, or close a native item at
  any value other than the true terminal `done` (see `leaf-only-lifecycle`).
- Touch `ready` **leaves** except to remove stale labels from a natively closed `NOT_PLANNED`
  item as above. Open ready leaves remain `lisa-intake`'s lane.
- Move a GitHub issue that already carries a configured lifecycle label back to `ready` merely
  because some other label looks stale. Official lifecycle labels remain authoritative.

## Cycle behavior

1. **Resolve the queue** — detect vendor/lifecycle (Source dispatch); resolve stuck role names
   from config. For JIRA, confirm the needed transitions are reachable; stop on misconfig.
2. **Enumerate repair candidates** — query in-progress role(s), `blocked` role(s), terminal/open
   items, GitHub parents (PRDs **and build Epic/Story containers**) whose discoverable children —
   generated-work fallback for a PRD, hierarchy/body-parentage for a build container — are missing from
   their native sub-issue graph, rollup parents/PRDs with child work, **containers carrying the `ready`
   role** (a
   leaf-only-invariant violation to reconcile), and GitHub issues with no configured lifecycle label,
   for the detected lifecycle(s), up to `max_candidates`, via the Access layer reads.
3. **Order deterministically**, highest repair-confidence first:
   1. terminal-labeled items that only need native close / complete / resolve,
   2. build `claimed` leaves whose linked PR is **already merged** — apply the env-resolved
      `claimed → done` close-out (staleness-exempt; no re-dispatch). This MUST run before any rollup
      bucket: a merged-PR leaf is a settled terminal state, and recovering it first means its parent
      rolls up to its true derived state in the **same** cycle. If this ran after rollup (or last,
      among generic stalled items), the parent would be reconciled against a not-yet-closed child and
      the shipped leaf would linger another cron pass — the failure this ordering exists to prevent,
   3. GitHub parents (PRDs missing native links for generated top-level work, or build Epic/Story
      containers missing native links for prose/hierarchy children) needing structure-only repair,
   4. rollup parents/PRDs whose child sets are all terminal (close-out),
   5. rollup parents whose children have advanced to an intermediate env, or stale-`ready`
      containers, that need their derived state applied (status-only reconciliation, no native
      close),
   6. `blocked` items whose dependencies are now **cleared** (safe, high-value, one-cycle wins),
   7. `blocked` items whose **validation / quality-gate self-block now re-validates PASS** —
      a human filled in the missing sections (Class B; equally safe and high-value),
   8. `blocked` items with **new clarifying answers**,
   9. GitHub missing-official-label normalization candidates,
   10. **stalled** in-progress items (PR not merged), oldest activity first.
4. **Walk the ordered list**, evaluating each candidate (terminal close-out, rollup child tally,
   staleness, dependency, answer checks), and repair **every** candidate that is actionable inside
   the `max_candidates` cap. Continue after successful writes and after per-item errors.
5. **Empty / nothing actionable** → exit cleanly:
   `"No stuck items actionable this cycle (examined N, all active or in backoff)."`
6. **Failure isolation** — if evaluating one candidate errors, record it under Errors and
   continue to the next; one bad item never aborts the cycle.

Process **all materially actionable repairs among the enumerated candidates** — scan up to
`max_candidates`, repair the actionable subset, then exit. This intentionally differs from
`lisa-intake`'s one-ready-item claim contract because repair work is bounded by an explicit cap and
often consists of cheap close-out reconciliation that should drain in one cron pass.

## Summary report

Report outcomes in these buckets:

- `resumed` — stalled in-progress work re-dispatched in place.
- `resynced` — a stalled build whose PR was merely behind its base, re-synced via
  `gh pr update-branch` so the already-enabled auto-merge can land; the item stays `claimed` for a
  later cycle to confirm the merge and transition.
- `recovered` — a stalled build whose PR had already merged, advanced by applying the env-resolved
  `claimed → done` transition build-intake never got to (no re-dispatch).
- `unblocked` — blocker cleared (or answers resolved); re-dispatched or transitioned to
  `ticketed`.
- `closed_out` — terminal-labeled items whose native open/active state was closed, completed,
  resolved, or archived.
- `rolled_up` — parent/container/PRD rollups advanced to their derived state: an intermediate env
  (e.g. all children at `On Stg` → parent `On Stg`), a fully-terminal close-out, or a stale-`ready`
  container reconciled from its children.
- `relinked` — GitHub parents (PRDs from the generated-work fallback, or build Epic/Story containers
  from hierarchy/body-parentage) whose missing native sub-issue links were attached.
- `normalized_ready` — GitHub issues missing official lifecycle labels that were classified and
  given the configured PRD/build `ready` label so normal intake can claim them.
- `held_for_person` — normalization candidates left exactly as they were because a person is
  holding them, per the human gate in step 2a of that repair. Nothing was written to them. This
  bucket is never merged into `normalized_ready` or `errors`: "a person parked this and I honoured
  it" is a repair outcome, not a failure and not a promotion.
- `still_blocked` — examined and intentionally left `blocked`, with the active reason.
- `reversal_suppressed` — a repair this skill previously made was reversed by a human, so the
  classification was **not** re-applied. Name the **reversed transition** (role, direction, and
  when), the classification that produced it, and that the item now carries `human_needed`. This
  bucket is never merged into `still_blocked`: "I declined to act because I was overruled" and "I
  examined it and the blocker stands" are different facts about the loop, and only the first tells
  an operator their correction was received.
- `active` — skipped because current work is not stale (or within backoff).
- `errors` — items that failed evaluation, with the error.

State every item repaired this cycle and the action taken. If the output would be long, group by
bucket and show compact refs plus counts.

## Run outcome

As the registered `intake-repair` automation loop, each cycle conforms to the
`automation-runbook-contract` rule: it ends in **exactly one** of the six run outcomes and records it,
so a cycle that found nothing stuck and a cycle where the repair machinery itself broke never look
alike. A run outcome describes this *cycle*; the Summary-report buckets above describe *what happened
to each item* — the two never merge in the one-line summary.

| This cycle's exit path | Run outcome |
|---|---|
| Nothing actionable — the idle case (walk step 5): examined N, all active or in backoff — including a fix ticket suppressed by a prior decline (`rejection-detection` **Proposal rejection memory**), which the summary names in its suppression count | `nothing-needed` |
| Repairs applied **and confirmed** this cycle — `resumed` / `resynced` / `recovered` / `unblocked` / `closed_out` / `rolled_up` / `relinked` / `normalized_ready` | `change-proved` |
| Repair produced new work for a human to pick up — e.g. an unmergeable PR or failed deploy filed as a **build-ready fix ticket** and left `blocked` | `candidate-proposed` |
| A repair reached an autonomy boundary needing a human (a protected-deploy approval before it can proceed), **or a repair this loop previously made was reversed by a human** and is therefore suppressed and escalated to `human_needed` (`reversal_suppressed`) rather than re-attempted | `approval-requested` |
| The loop itself could not run — the queue is unreadable, tracker credentials are revoked, or an open-and-closed rejection-memory / blocker-marker search is unreadable and therefore must not fall through to `nothing-needed` | `recovery-required` |
| The runbook's **Retirement condition** tripped | `policy-obsolete` — **never reached by design for this loop** (see Retirement evaluation below) |

Record **exactly one** outcome per invocation through the run-record CLI, naming this loop's runbook
(the `--summary` is the operator-readable one-liner in the contract's exemplar voice — plain,
specific, actionable, e.g. `Examined 14 items; all active or in backoff — nothing to repair.` for
`nothing-needed`):

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-node_modules/@codyswann/lisa/plugins/lisa}/scripts/automation-run-record.mjs" \
  --loop-id intake-repair --outcome change-proved \
  --summary "Recovered 3 stalled builds and closed out 2 rollups; all confirmed." \
  --runbook .lisa/automations/intake-repair.runbook.md [--ref <item-url>]...
```

The `:-` default in that command is load-bearing, not decoration. `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` is **not
exported into an agent's Bash tool environment**, so the bare `"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/…"`
form expands to an absolute `/scripts/…` and exits 1. The default names the installed package copy,
which resolves from the **consumer repository root** — which is where the recorder is actually
invoked. Never substitute a bare `plugins/lisa/scripts/…` or `plugins/src/base/scripts/…` path:
those are relative to the **Lisa package root**, not the repository you are standing in, and exit 1
from there. If recording still fails, **degrade, never abort** (per `automation-runbook-contract`):
note the recording failure in the run output and finish the cycle — a recording failure is a
degradation to report, never a reason to block the loop.

**Retirement evaluation (every run).** The `intake-repair` loop is **structural to the
factory — it does not retire.** Its runbook says so plainly instead of leaving the Retirement
condition blank, so the `automation-runbook-contract` rule's two-part retirement test never fires
here: this loop never records `policy-obsolete` and never files a teardown proposal. An operator who
wants repair to stop runs `/lisa:tear-down-automations` themselves — the loop never removes its own
registration.

## Schedule examples

```text
/schedule "every 2 hours" /lisa:repair-intake https://www.notion.so/<workspace>/<database-id>
/schedule "every 2 hours" /lisa:repair-intake https://linear.app/acme
/schedule "every 2 hours" /lisa:repair-intake acme/product-prds
/schedule "every 2 hours" /lisa:repair-intake acme/frontend-v2 intake_mode=build
/schedule "every 2 hours" /lisa:repair-intake acme/frontend intake_mode=both build_queue=acme/planning
/schedule "every 4 hours" /lisa:repair-intake SE stale_after=12h
/lisa:repair-intake SE stale_after=0 force=true        # manual: treat all in-progress as stalled, ignore backoff
```

Run repair-intake **less frequently than** `lisa-intake` (the ready queue moves faster than
stuck work accumulates), or interleaved on a longer cadence.

## Rules

- Never run a cycle without an explicit queue. Side effects too high to default.
- Never reset stalled in-progress items to `ready` — resume in place (decision tree).
- Never mutate product-owned states (`draft`, `verified`) or set `verified`; PRD rollup close-out
  may move open generated-work PRDs to `shipped` and close/archive them only after all associated
  child work is terminal.
- Apply build `done` ONLY via the env-resolution rules, and trigger native closure only at the
  true terminal `done` value (`leaf-only-lifecycle`).
- A `blocked` build item's blocker may be a dependency, a validation/quality-gate self-block (no
  dependency — re-check by re-running `lisa-tracker-validate` against current content), or an
  ambiguity. Re-check every class present; do not treat "no `is blocked by` links" as "nothing to
  do."
- Never re-dispatch a `blocked` build item unless every parsed blocker is cleared (conservative
  dependency clearing).
- Never re-make a transition a human reversed. Classify every candidate for `automation-reversal`
  before any lifecycle write (`rejection-detection`), and on a hit leave the item where the human
  put it with `human_needed`, naming the reversed transition in the run record. Re-attempt only on
  evidence postdating the reversal.
- Never remove a `human_needed` marker this skill did not apply, and consult the marker before
  **any** repair transition rather than only before Class C.
- Repair every materially actionable candidate inside the `max_candidates` cap; default cap is 100.
- Default GitHub `intake_mode` is `both` when both PRD and build namespaces exist.
- Honor the backoff window — never re-post an identical `[lisa-repair-intake]` note within it
  (unless `force=true`).
- Never run two repair cycles concurrently against overlapping queues, and never run
  repair-intake against a queue `lisa-intake` is concurrently draining — the scheduling layer is
  responsible for serialization.
- Stop and surface failures rather than retry-loop.
