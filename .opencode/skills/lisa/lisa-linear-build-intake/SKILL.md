# Linear Build Intake: $ARGUMENTS

## Human-gate release authorization

A release requires a trusted human author, not just matching comment text. Follow
`ready-role-filing` — **Human-gate release authorization**: preserve tracker-supplied comment
author IDs and bot metadata, resolve `trustedHumanActorIds` only from an explicit user instruction
or existing human-authored trusted project policy, and pass it with structured `comments` to every
hold classifier, reconciliation, normalization and release planner. Never derive trust from the
comment body, a display name, the actor's own assertion, or an automation posting on its own behalf.
Missing policy, missing/unreadable author identity, raw body strings, untrusted actors and known bots
cannot discharge a hold. Keep the item held and report the missing authorization; do not silently
replace these inputs with an empty history or an inferred allowlist. Authorized matching releases
continue through the existing path and never override an independently declared caller hold.


`$ARGUMENTS` is one of:

1. A Linear team key (e.g. `ENG`) — scans that team for ready Issues.
2. The literal token `linear` — falls back to `linear.teamKey` from `.lisa.config.json`.
3. A pre-built Linear MCP filter (advanced) — used as-is.

Run one build-intake cycle. The first eligible ready Issue is claimed, built via the `linear-agent` workflow run in-session (Phase 3c, culminating in `lisa-implement`), transitioned to the configured `done` state on completion, then the cycle exits. Remaining ready Issues stay queued for later scheduler invocations.

This skill is the destination of the `lisa-tracker-build-intake` shim when `tracker = "linear"`.

## Workflow resolution

Build-queue **workflow state** names are read from `.lisa.config.json` `linear.workflow.*`. Required roles must be configured; optional roles are allowed to resolve empty. Bash pattern:

```bash
read_role() {
  # Single resolver — see config-resolution "The single resolver".
  # Exit 0 + empty output means an OPTIONAL role is unset: skip that transition,
  # never substitute a default. Any non-zero status is a resolver failure and
  # remains visible to the caller.
  node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-${PLUGIN_ROOT:-plugins/lisa}}/scripts/resolve-lifecycle-role.mjs" \
    --role "$1" --vendor linear --intent "${2:-read}"
}

READY=$(read_role ready read) || exit $?
CLAIMED=$(read_role claimed write) || exit $?
REVIEW=$(read_role review write) || exit $?
BLOCKED=$(read_role blocked read) || exit $?
```

For env-keyed `done`, resolve the env first, then look up `done[<env>]`:

1. Explicit caller arg (`target_env=staging`) wins.
2. Otherwise, infer the env from the PR's base branch via `deploy.branches` (reverse lookup).
3. If `done` is a **string** in config, use it directly regardless of env.
4. If `done` is a **map** and env cannot be resolved, **fail loudly** — do not pick arbitrarily.
5. **Promotion completeness caps the result.** The base branch names the environment the change
   *entered*, never the environments it has *reached*. Walk `deploy.order` from its lowest rung and
   write the highest **contiguously reached** rung at or below the resolved env: a rung is reached
   only when the merge commit is an ancestor of its `deploy.branches` branch
   (`git merge-base --is-ancestor <merge-sha> origin/<branch>`, asserted for **every** env branch at
   or below the resolved one — not only the PR's base) **and** that branch's most recent
   deploy **concluded `success`** (read the `conclusion`, never the `status`; only `success`
   promotes — a null conclusion and every other conclusion, `failure` / `cancelled` / `timed_out` /
   `neutral` / `skipped` / `stale` / `action_required`, leave the rung unreached, and an in-flight
   deploy is unknown, not green). Where `deploy.order` is absent the ladder is the single resolved
   env; where a branch exposes no deploy surface at all, ancestry alone decides that rung. A hotfix
   merged straight to the production branch that skipped `staging` therefore writes the rung below
   the gap and stays open. The recorded reason carries all three fields —
   `<first unreached env> (<its branch>) — <condition>`, the condition being `missing ancestry`,
   `deploy unknown: <run URL, or "no concluded run">`, or
   `deploy concluded <conclusion>: <run URL>`; a failing run named without its environment and
   branch is an incomplete reason. An open back-fill PR against a
   skipped environment branch is outstanding delivery, not branch hygiene. See `config-resolution`
   → "Promotion completeness".

```bash
TARGET_ENV="${target_env:-}"
if [ -z "$TARGET_ENV" ] && [ -n "$PR_BASE_BRANCH" ]; then
  TARGET_ENV=$(jq -r --arg b "$PR_BASE_BRANCH" \
    '.deploy.branches // {} | to_entries[] | select(.value == $b) | .key' \
    .lisa.config.json 2>/dev/null | head -1)
fi

DONE_TYPE=$(jq -r '.linear.workflow.done | type' .lisa.config.json 2>/dev/null)
if [ "$DONE_TYPE" = "string" ]; then
  DONE=$(jq -r '.linear.workflow.done' .lisa.config.json)
elif [ "$DONE_TYPE" = "object" ]; then
  [ -z "$TARGET_ENV" ] && { echo "ERROR: linear.workflow.done is env-keyed but env not resolvable"; exit 1; }
  DONE=$(jq -r --arg e "$TARGET_ENV" '.linear.workflow.done[$e] // empty' .lisa.config.json)
  [ -z "$DONE" ] && { echo "ERROR: linear.workflow.done has no entry for env '$TARGET_ENV'"; exit 1; }
else
  case "$TARGET_ENV" in
    dev) DONE="On Dev" ;;
    staging) DONE="On Stg" ;;
    production) DONE="Done" ;;
    *) echo "ERROR: cannot resolve done state without env"; exit 1 ;;
  esac
fi
```

In prose below, the role names refer to the configured **states**: e.g. "the `ready` state" means whatever `linear.workflow.ready` resolves to. Required roles must be configured; optional roles carry no default.

## Why native states, not labels

Linear Issues carry first-class workflow states with a machine-readable `type` (`backlog` / `unstarted` / `started` / `completed` / `canceled`) — the same shape JIRA statuses have, and the reason this adapter mirrors `lisa-jira-build-intake` rather than `lisa-github-build-intake`. GitHub Issues has no such field, so labels are the only lane available *there*; that is a constraint of GitHub's data model, not a preference Linear shares.

Driving this queue off labels (as it was until the state migration) left two writers on one lifecycle: Linear's own git automations move `state` on merge while Lisa moved only labels, so the two disagreed permanently on any merge that did not run through a Lisa flow — and `On Dev` / `On Stg` could never appear on a board, cycle or insight, because Linear groups by state.

The old objection was that per-team state names vary and get renamed. That is equally true of the JIRA statuses Lisa keys on regardless, and Linear additionally exposes the rename-proof `type` discriminator. Names live in `linear.workflow`, so a rename is a one-key override.

**Consequence for terminal closure:** native closure is no longer a separate step bolted onto a label transition. Moving to the terminal `done` state **is** the closure, and `leaf-only-lifecycle`'s "terminal native closure" requirement is satisfied by the same write that sets the role. The intermediate env rungs are typed `started`, not `completed`, so an Issue on `On Dev` correctly reads as open work.

## Configuration

Reads `linear.workspace`, `linear.teamKey`, and `linear.workflow.*` from `.lisa.config.json` (with `.local` override).

## Confirmation policy

Do NOT ask the caller whether to proceed. Once invoked with a team key, run the cycle to completion — claim and dispatch the first eligible Issue through the in-session lifecycle (Phase 3c), transition a successful build to `$DONE`, write the summary, and exit. The caller (a human or a cron) has already authorized the run by invoking the skill.

Specifically forbidden:

- Previewing projected scope (Issue count, projected PR count, build duration) and asking whether to continue.
- Offering A/B/C-style choices like "proceed / skip a few / dry-run only" — the documented behavior IS the default.
- Pausing because the queue is large, items look complex, or items are likely to be moved to `$BLOCKED` by the pre-flight gate. The pre-flight `$BLOCKED` outcome is a valid terminal state of the per-Issue lifecycle.
- Pausing because the build flow looks expensive.

The only legitimate reasons to stop early:

- Missing team key or required configuration. Surface and exit.
- Workflow states not yet adopted (the `ready` state does not exist on the team). Surface and exit with an Adoption hint pointing at `/lisa:setup:linear`.
- Empty pre-work set. Exit cleanly on the denominator-stated summary from `summarizeDryLane` — which names every lane swept, its count, and the open total. A bare "nothing to do" is not an acceptable exit: it is indistinguishable from a wrong denominator (#2657).

## Lifecycle assumed

The Linear build queue uses native issue **workflow states**:

```text
ready → claimed → review → done(env-keyed) (downstream)
(human/PM)    (us claim)    (us PR ready)    (us build done)
```

(Defaults: `Ready` / `In Progress` / `In Review` / `On Dev`/`On Stg`/`Done`.)

This skill ONLY transitions `$READY → $CLAIMED` on claim, and `$CLAIMED → $DONE` on completion. It never touches the terminal production `done` or `$REVIEW` (owned by the lifecycle / `lisa-linear-evidence`). It never *sets* `$BLOCKED` either — that stays owned by the pre-flight gate — but Phase 2.5 does move an Issue **out** of a pre-work blocked lane back to `$READY` when it re-probes the Issue's own stated discharge condition and finds it no longer holds, recording the discharging evidence on the Issue.

**Pre-flight check**: at start of each cycle, confirm `$READY`, `$CLAIMED`, and the relevant `$DONE` variants exist on the team via `lisa-linear-access operation: list-workflow-states`. If `$READY` is missing, stop and report adoption needed. **Unlike labels, a missing state cannot be created on demand here** — a workflow state is team configuration with a `type` and a board position, and guessing either would put an Issue somewhere a human did not sanction. Any missing state is a setup defect: report it, name the role and the expected state, and point at `/lisa:setup:linear`.

## Phases

### Phase 1 — Resolve scope

1. Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:
   - Bare team key → use as-is.
   - Literal `linear` → fall back to `linear.teamKey` from config.
2. Resolve team ID via `lisa-linear-access operation: list-teams({query: <teamKey>})`.

### Phase 2 — Sweep every pre-work lane by state TYPE

**Sweep by `type`, never by a roster of state names.** Linear state types are `backlog | unstarted | started | completed | canceled`, and there is no `blocked` type — a team that wants a `Blocked` lane models it as **`unstarted`**, i.e. work that was *never started*. Selecting candidates from a hardcoded `Backlog / Todo / Ready` name list therefore omits an entire pre-work lane and reports an empty queue over a full one. Measured on one team: the name sweep saw **39 of 343 open rows**; the type sweep sees **100**, and the 61-row difference produced 31 consecutive false "dry lane" cycles (#2657).

1. List the team's workflow states via `lisa-linear-access operation: list-workflow-states`.
2. Keep every state whose `type` is `backlog` or `unstarted` — that is the pre-work set. `$READY` is one member of it, not the whole of it.
3. Query each pre-work state: `lisa-linear-access operation: list-issues({team: <teamId>, state: "<state>"})`, following `endCursor` until `hasNextPage=false`. Deduplicate issue IDs. A failed page or non-advancing cursor makes the read incomplete; report it and end the cycle without dispatching. Do not infer completeness from a single page's size.
4. Also read the **total open** count for the team using the same terminal set as the child check below: exclude `completed`, `canceled`, and `duplicate`. Intermediate deployment states remain open.

Report the query scope, pages read and distinct issue count. If a previous read
or a known issue contradicts the result, re-read that evidence before declaring
the queue empty. Identifier ranges and gaps are diagnostics, not proof of
completeness: filters, deleted issues and unseen omissions can all affect them.
The historical 249-row report did not establish a root-connection defect, so it
does not justify changing connections or adding a separate range-validation gate.

Capture each Issue's: identifier, title, type label, priority, assignee, project, state (with its `type`), labels, description summary.

Build the denominator with the shared helper, which owns the type vocabulary so no two scanners can disagree about what counts as pre-work:

```bash
node -e '
import("'"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-./node_modules/@codyswann/lisa/plugins/lisa}"'/scripts/intake-prework-denominator.mjs").then(m => {
  const d = m.buildIntakeDenominator({ lanes: JSON.parse(process.argv[1]), totalOpen: Number(process.argv[2]) });
  console.log(JSON.stringify(d));
  console.log(m.summarizeDryLane(d, { queue: process.argv[3] }));
});' "$LANES_JSON" "$TOTAL_OPEN" "team $TEAM_KEY"
```

The `./` on that default is load-bearing and is not the same as the recorder's. `import()` reads a bare `node_modules/…` as a **package specifier** named `node_modules` and fails with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND: Cannot find package 'node_modules'`; only `./`, `../`, `/` or a `file:` URL is a path. A `node <path>` command line has no such rule, which is why the run-recorder default alongside this one carries no `./`.

`$LANES_JSON` is `[{"name":"<state>","type":"<state.type>","position":<state.position>,"count":<open rows>}, …]` for **every** state on the team, pre-work and not — the helper does the selecting.

**Candidate order.** Work `$READY` first (it is the human-flipped signal), then the remaining pre-work lanes oldest-first. Every candidate outside `$READY` must clear Phase 2.5 before it is treated as a candidate at all.

> **No query-time repo pre-filter here (by design).** Unlike `lisa-jira-build-intake`, which narrows its JQL with `AND (labels = "repo:<current>" OR labels IS EMPTY)` (the query-time arm of `repo-scope-split`), the Linear `list_issues` label filter is an AND-of-labels and cannot express "current-repo **or** unlabeled" in one query. Adding `repo:<current>` to this query would strand unlabeled Issues the determine + stamp path must see. So the Linear scanner keeps this query broad and relies on the per-candidate 3a.0 gate below for repo scoping. (The `state` filter above is orthogonal to that — it narrows the lifecycle lane, not the repo, and is a single-valued equality so it has none of the AND-of-labels problem.)

If every pre-work lane is empty, or nothing survives Phase 2.5, exit on the **denominator-stated** summary from `summarizeDryLane` — never a bare "nothing to do". See "Run outcome" below; the run recorder rejects a dry build-intake run that does not name what it swept.

### Phase 2.5 — Re-probe the blockers instead of inheriting them

A blocker is a **claim with a timestamp, not a fact**. It is written once and goes stale the moment its condition comes true — a dependency lands on trunk, an advisory gets patched, a package publishes. Nothing re-read one before this phase, so a discharged blocker held its Issue out of the queue indefinitely. Measured: one Issue's stated condition went true ~15 hours before anything noticed.

For each pre-work candidate that is **not** in `$READY`:

1. **Read release comments before applying the human gate.** Pass all item comments, labels,
   body, `trustedHumanActorIds` and configured `humanNeededLabel` to `classifyReadyCandidate(...)`. For a discharged hold,
   call `planHumanGateRelease({ labels, body, comments, trustedHumanActorIds, humanNeededLabel, readyLabel, lifecycleLabels, alreadyNotified })`
   and retain its plan. Apply human-marker cleanup only as planned; defer any ready-role restoration
   until steps 2–5 have cleared the remaining blockers (map the role to the vendor's state or label).
   A still-active hold is never auto-selected, whatever any probe says. An absent or unreadable
   comment history cannot discharge a hold. A release removes only the human hold: continue the
   remaining blocker checks below before selecting the item.

2. **Extract the stated discharge condition** from the description or the most recent blocking comment — the sentence naming what has to become true.
3. **Probe it.** Machine-testable conditions are the ones that rot fastest and are cheapest to check: a version on trunk (`git show origin/<trunk>:<manifest>`), a published package, a run history (`gh run list`), an advisory's patched status. A condition that is a human decision is not machine-testable — leave it and move on.
4. **Classify with the shared helper** so the ordering and the evidence requirement cannot drift per vendor:

```text
classifyPreWorkCandidate({ laneType, labels, body, comments, trustedHumanActorIds, humanNeededLabel, statedBlocker, probe })
  → { selectable, reason, humanGated, evidence }
```

   A discharge with **no recorded evidence is not a discharge** — the helper refuses it. So is a candidate nothing probed this cycle.

5. **Record the result on the Issue either way**, via `lisa-linear-access operation: save-comment` using `formatReprobeNote(...)`, so the next cycle reads the answer rather than re-deriving it. Keep it idempotent — skip the post when an identical note already exists.
6. **On `selectable: true`**, move the Issue to `$READY` (recording the discharging evidence in the same comment) and treat it as an ordinary candidate from Phase 3 onward. On anything else, leave the Issue exactly where it is.

### Phase 3 — Process the first eligible ready Issue

#### 3.0 Human-hold gate (absolute, and it runs before every other gate)

A person parks an item by putting `[lisa-human-gate]` in its description. That marker used to be
read only for candidates **outside** `$READY` (Phase 2's blocker re-probe), so an item already in
the ready lane was claimed with the hold never consulted — one was dispatched and fully implemented
before a human vetoed the merge. The check was correct; it was unreachable from the path that
matters.

Run this **first**, ahead of the repo-scope gate (3a.0) and the leaf-only gate (3a), for every ready
candidate. Ordering is load-bearing for the same reason it is inside `classifyPreWorkCandidate`: no
other gate's verdict — however conclusive — may promote an item a person parked.

1. **Classify with `classifyReadyCandidate(...)`** from `scripts/intake-blocker-reprobe.mjs`. It
   shares the gate test with the pre-work classifier deliberately — two copies of a substring test
   drift, and a drifted gate fails *silently*, by quietly ceasing to match. Do **not** re-implement
   the test here, and do **not** key it on `reason=`: markers in the wild carry no `reason=` key at
   all and sit anywhere in the body, so a structured parse would miss them while appearing to work
   on every item that happens to have one. **Pass the item's structured `comments` and `trustedHumanActorIds` alongside its labels and
   body.** A hold is ended by a release recorded in a comment, so a reader handed no comments cannot
   see the discharge — it goes on holding an item whose question was answered weeks ago, which is
   the defect this gate carried from the day it was written (CodySwannGT/lisa#3852). Omitting them
   fails closed, and that is exactly why it is easy to miss: nothing breaks, the item simply never
   comes back.
2. **On `claimable: false` with reason `human-gate`, do not claim and do not dispatch.**
3. **Reconcile the lane; do not merely skip.** Skipping alone leaves the item in `$READY`, re-judged
   and re-rejected every cycle forever and seen by nothing — `lisa-repair-intake` sweeps items that
   are **not** in the ready role and excludes gated ones outright, so a ready-and-gated item falls
   outside its filter twice over. Call
   `planHumanGateReconciliation({ labels, body, comments, trustedHumanActorIds, humanNeededLabel, readyLabel, alreadyNotified })`
   and apply exactly the actions it returns: remove `$READY`, add the configured human-needed
   marker, and post `formatHumanGateNote()` once. The planner is idempotent by state, so an item
   already out of the lane and already marked yields no second mutation and no second comment. This
   is the same repair the leaf-only gate already performs for a ready item that must not be
   dispatched.
4. **On `claimable: true` for an item that still carries a hold, RELEASE it — do not just proceed.**
   This ready-lane candidate can retain a historical body marker and a human-needed label.
   This step reconciles only candidates still in the ready lane; released holds outside it are
   recovered by `lisa-repair-intake` step 2b (or Phase 2.5 when included in this cycle). Call
   `planHumanGateRelease({ labels, body, comments, trustedHumanActorIds, humanNeededLabel, readyLabel, lifecycleLabels, alreadyNotified })`
   and apply exactly the actions it returns: remove the configured human-needed marker, add the
   configured ready role back, and post `formatHumanGateReleaseNote()` once. It is the exact inverse
   of step 3's planner and it refuses in both directions — an item still held plans nothing, and an
   item never held plans nothing, so it can only ever un-do a hold and can never promote something on
   its own. It is idempotent by state, so a second cycle over a released item yields no second
   mutation and no second comment.

   **Never edit the description to clear a hold.** The only body write available is a whole-body
   replacement, so deleting one line means rewriting the whole record and hoping nothing was
   dropped — the reason holds accumulated instead of being lifted. The hold note stays in the
   description as history; the release is a comment beside it.
5. **Name it in the cycle summary** via `summarizeHumanGateHolds([...])`, so the record
   distinguishes "nothing was eligible" from "something eligible was held for a person". A lane
   mutation nobody can see afterwards is the same class of problem this gate exists to fix.
   Report alongside it what the precision rule SKIPPED, via `summarizeHumanGateMentions(n)`
   — the marker occurrences that were mentions rather than declarations (CodySwannGT/lisa#3815).
   A rule that quietly declines to honour half the occurrences it sees reads exactly like a
   rule that saw none, so the count is printed even when it is zero. Report what was RELEASED
   beside it via `summarizeHumanGateReleases([...])`, printed even when it is zero: a release path
   that has stopped working and a cycle with nothing to release read identically otherwise, which
   is how a missing inverse stays missing.
6. **Continue to the next candidate.** A held item does not end the cycle.


#### 3a.0 Repo-scope gate (claim only current-repo Issues)

A Linear team can oversee multiple repos (`frontend` / `backend` / `infrastructure`). This skill claims only Issues for the repo it is running in. Run this gate **before** the leaf-only gate (3a) and the claim (3b), per the `repo-scope-split` rule's "Claim-time repo scoping" section (cite it by slug; do not restate its decision table).

1. **Resolve the current repo** per `config-resolution` "Repo scoping" (`.repo` → `.github.repo` → `git remote get-url origin` basename). If unresolvable, stop and report.
2. **Cheap path first.** Prefer candidates already carrying the `repo:<current>` label. Keep the Phase 2 scan broad so unlabeled Issues are still seen, determined, and stamped.
3. **Per candidate, apply the repo-scope decision (`repo-scope-split`):**
   - **Count distinct repository markers first**: collect all `repo:<name>` labels and, on JIRA, recognized repository components; deduplicate by repository. A container may carry multiple `repo:<name>` labels. Do not split or claim it here; send it to the leaf-only gate.
   - **Multi-repo leaf → split, never claim.** More than one repository takes the work-time split before any wrong-repository skip. Each sibling is **build-ready** (`build_ready: true`) and stamped with its own `repo:<name>`; the current repo's sibling becomes a normal candidate.
   - **Exactly one other repository** (`repo:<other>`) → **skip**, leaving the item ready for that repo's intake.
   - **No repository marker** → determine target repo(s) from the ticket and code, stamp `repo:<name>` through the vendor access layer, and re-apply from the count.
   - **Single-repo leaf for the current repo** → fall through to 3a and 3b.

4. Continue until a claimable current-repo leaf is found (claim it; one per cycle) or the candidate set is exhausted — exit cleanly on the denominator-stated summary, naming the current repo alongside the swept lanes.

#### 3a. Leaf-only claim gate (skip / safe-block containers)

Build intake claims **only independently implementable leaf work units**. This enforces the claim-time arm of the vendor-neutral `leaf-only-lifecycle` rule: a parent/container that still sits in the build-ready state (e.g. moved to `$READY` before this rule existed, or hand-moved on a Project-grouped parent Issue) is **never claimed** — intake skips it or safe-blocks it with a clear lifecycle-repair message. It is the claim-time complement to the write-time state assignment in `lisa-linear-write-issue` and the validate-time S15 gate in `lisa-linear-validate-issue`; all three cite the same rule so the classification never drifts. **Never silently implement a container.**

Run this gate **before** the claim transition, starting with the oldest/highest-priority ready candidate. Do NOT transition, comment "Claimed", or dispatch the lifecycle for an Issue that fails the gate.

**Resolve container vs. leaf — structural first, then nominal.** Per `leaf-only-lifecycle` the classification is structural: an Issue is a **container** if it has **open** child work, whatever its declared type; otherwise the **type label** decides. Resolve child work using the same hierarchy `lisa-linear-read-issue` uses — Linear's native parentage: an Issue groups **sub-issues** via `parentId`, and a **Project** (the Epic equivalent) groups Issues via `projectId`. Relations (`save_issue_relation` — `blocks` / `is blocked by`) express dependencies and are **not** parentage — do not count them as children.

Fetch the Issue's sub-issues via `lisa-linear-access operation: get-issue` (which returns the children) or `lisa-linear-access operation: list-issues({parentId: <issueId>})`, then count those still open (Linear `state.type` not in the completed/canceled/duplicate set):

```text
# Children of <issueId>: native sub-issues via parentId.
# Count children whose Linear state.type is NOT terminal ("completed" / "canceled" / "duplicate").
# "duplicate" is a first-class Linear state.type (distinct from "canceled"): an Issue marked
# as a duplicate is closed and must NOT be counted as open, or the parent never rolls up.
# A parent whose children are all terminal is no longer holding open work and
# rolls up via leaf-only-lifecycle's rollup, not here.
OPEN_CHILDREN = count(list_issues({parentId: <issueId>})
                       where state.type not in {"completed", "canceled", "duplicate"})
```

For a Project-level parent (an Issue that itself anchors a `projectId` grouping rather than a `parentId` tree), resolve membership the same way `lisa-linear-read-issue` does and treat the parent as a container if any grouped Issue is still open. If sub-issue resolution is unavailable, fall back to the parentage `lisa-linear-read-issue` derives and treat the Issue as a container if any derived child is open. Note "sub-issues unavailable — parentage derived" so the operator knows how children were resolved.

Classify and act (first match wins). The type comes from the Issue's `type:` label (`type:Epic`, `type:Story`, `type:Spike`, `type:Bug`, `type:Task`, `type:Sub-task`, `type:Improvement`):

| Condition | Class | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `OPEN_CHILDREN > 0` (open child work, any type) | **Container** | **Skip / safe-block — do NOT claim** |
| no open children AND type = Epic (a Linear Project) | **Childless Epic/Project (pure rollup container)** | **Skip / safe-block — do NOT claim** |
| no open children AND type ≠ Epic (Bug, Task, Sub-task, Improvement, Story, Spike, or no `type:` label) | **Leaf work unit** | **Proceed to 3b claim** |

The childless-parent exception promotes every childless type **except Epic** to a claimable leaf: a childless Story is a directly shippable increment and a childless Spike *is* the investigation unit, so neither is stranded. Only a childless **Epic** (a Linear Project) stays unclaimed — it is a pure rollup container by design, and a childless one is an incomplete decomposition or a mis-applied role, never an implementable unit.

**Safe-block (default action for a flagged container).** Leave the Issue in the build-ready state (don't silently move it — that hides the lifecycle error), post a single lifecycle-repair comment, record the Issue under "Skipped (container)" in the summary, and end the cycle. Do NOT transition to `$CLAIMED`. Keep the comment idempotent — skip posting if an identical `[claude-build-intake]` lifecycle-repair comment already exists on the Issue, so a re-entrant cycle doesn't spam it.

Post via `lisa-linear-access operation: save-comment` with:

```text
[claude-build-intake] Not claimed: this Issue sits in the build-ready state ($READY) but is a container with open child work (or a childless Epic), which violates the leaf-only-lifecycle rule. Build-ready is leaf-only per leaf-only-lifecycle — an agent claims and implements leaves, never a container. Repair: move the build-ready role off this parent onto its leaf children (or, for a childless Epic, decompose it into leaf children or reclassify it to a leaf type). A parent's lifecycle state rolls up from its children and is never set to ready directly.
```

This gate never blocks a legitimate flat Task/Bug: those have no open children and a leaf `type:`, so they fall straight through to the claim in 3b.

#### 3b. Claim

Before the claim mutation, apply `claim-time-guards` — **Value before claim**, or **Worth doing** in `lisa-track` on runtimes without the rule tree (Antigravity). A ready label establishes neither value nor permission to expand scope. Respect the preceding human-hold gate; a declined incidental item consumes this cycle's one processed disposition.


**Rejection detection runs first — before the transition below.** Per the vendor-neutral `rejection-detection` rule (cite the slug; do not restate its classification table), classify this Issue at the **top of 3b, BEFORE** the `$READY → $CLAIMED` transition — afterwards the current-lane signal is gone. Read the Issue's history via `lisa-linear-access operation: history id: <ISSUE-ID>`, keyed on **workflow-state** history, and classify it `rejection-reclaim | forward-only | never-left-ready | unknown` (a `rejection-reclaim` is a move back into `$READY` from a later lane). State names come from `.lisa.config.json`, never hardcoded.

> Reading state history is strictly simpler than the label history this used to key on: `IssueHistory` inlines `fromState.name` / `toState.name` on each node, so the transition is read directly with no label-ID resolution against `list-issue-labels` and no reconstruction from `addedLabelIds`/`removedLabelIds` deltas. That reconstruction was lossy — the deltas carry no prior/next full set — which is one more reason the build lane moved to states. A failing/absent history yields `unknown` and the claim proceeds — detection never blocks the build. Issues carrying a learning marker (`[lisa-learning-drop]` / `[lisa-learning-pr]` / `[lisa-learning-upstream-handoff]`) or the `learning:needs-triage` label are never rejection triggers (no learning-about-learning). Carry the classification into the transition and lifecycle below.

**On `rejection-reclaim`, reflect before re-implementing** (per `rejection-detection`): read the rejection evidence through the access layer — the Issue comments posted after the backward transition (the QA rejection comment) via `lisa-linear-access operation: list-comments` and the review threads on the rejected PR — assemble ONE candidate learning (rule, why, provenance linking the rejection comment + rejected PR, evidence links, scope hint, triggering issue, fingerprint `sll4-sha1(rule\ntriggering_issue)[:12]`), and route it to the `lisa-persist-learning` skill. If that skill is absent, record the candidate via `lisa-linear-access operation: save-comment` as a comment carrying a **visible prose line plus** the marker (a bare marker renders as an empty bubble) — `Recorded a candidate learning from this rejection (queued for the judgment gate): <one-line candidate rule>.` then `<!-- [lisa-rejection-candidate] key=<issue>-<transition-ts> -->` — and proceed. Dedupe on `<issue>-<backward-transition-timestamp>` — a second re-claim produces no duplicate. Unreadable/absent evidence → no candidate, still implement.

**Claim-time archaeology runs second — after rejection detection, still before the transition below.** Classify this Issue per the vendor-neutral `claim-archaeology` rule, with the rejection classification above as its input. All shared semantics — ancestry signals, classification, learning-loop exclusion, cost budget, candidate derivation, marker dedupe, and the never-block degrade — live in that one slug; change them there, never here. Linear wiring only: the native relations are already in the read bundle; text-similarity searches run through `lisa-linear-access operation: list-issues` filtered to recently-closed Issues; the fallback candidate comment is posted via `lisa-linear-access operation: save-comment`.

**The two `claim-time-guards` run third and fourth — still before the transition below.** Both semantics live in that one vendor-neutral slug; do not restate them here. Linear wiring only:

1. **`two-failed-attempts` valve.** Count `[lisa-build-attempt]` markers on the Issue from the read bundle's comments (match on the marker, never the title), applying both filters from `claim-time-guards`: count a marker only when it carries `measures=work` (a marker with no `measures=` counts as `work`), and only when its timestamp is **after the Issue most recently entered the ready state**. Read that transition with `lisa-linear-access operation: history id:<ID>`. If the history cannot be read, count every `measures=work` marker regardless of age and say so in the comment. With two or more surviving markers, do **not** claim: invoke `lisa-linear-access operation: save-issue lifecycle_role: blocked` (the access layer resolves `linear.workflow.blocked` itself per `config-resolution`; this skill supplies the role, never a state ID), post the operator-readable comment naming both attempts via `save-comment`, and **stop the cycle** at Phase 3e. Every non-success terminal outcome recorded in 3c/3d also appends a fresh `<!-- [lisa-build-attempt] n=<N> outcome=<outcome> measures=<work|machine> -->` marker so the next cycle can count it — `measures=machine` when the run was terminated by a signal or its outcome was `recovery-required`, `measures=work` when the build ran and did not satisfy the Issue.
2. **`already-implemented` check.** Probe for this Issue's own key — `git log --all --grep "<IDENTIFIER>"` and the merged/open PRs referencing `<IDENTIFIER>` (`gh pr list --state all --search "<IDENTIFIER>"` in the bound repo; Linear's own GitHub attachments in the read bundle are the cheaper first look). On a hit, claim as normal but route 3c to **verify-and-close** instead of `lisa-implement`: verify what shipped against the Issue's acceptance criteria, post evidence via `lisa-linear-evidence` naming the shipping PR/commit, then run the ordinary 3d transition and rollup. A partial hit implements only the remaining gap. An unreadable history degrades to "no hit" and the ordinary path proceeds — the guard never blocks the claim. This is not `DUPLICATE_ALREADY_FIXED` (a *different* canonical Issue) and not `claim-archaeology` (a *different* ancestor Issue); it is this Issue's own work already having shipped without a transition.

Transition the Issue via `lisa-linear-access operation: save-issue lifecycle_role: claimed`. The access layer resolves the `claimed` role's exact configured state against the team catalog and dispatches that ID; a missing or ambiguous `$CLAIMED` state is a setup defect it refuses on (see the pre-flight check) — never create one here.

**Assign to the authenticated user when the Issue is unassigned.** A claim must be attributable. If the Issue has no assignee, set its `assigneeId` to the authenticated viewer (resolve the viewer's id via the Linear MCP identity — e.g. `get_user` for the current actor) through `lisa-linear-access operation: save-issue`. Leave an already-assigned Issue's assignee untouched — never reassign work that already has an owner.

Post a `[claude-build-intake]` comment via `save_comment`: `"Claimed by Claude. Starting build."`

This is the idempotency lock — a re-entrant cycle's `state: $READY` filter will not see this Issue again.

If the transition fails (permission, race), record under "Errors" and skip. **Do not invoke the build flow on an Issue you didn't successfully claim.**

#### 3c. Run the per-Issue lifecycle in-session (never as a subagent)

After the claim succeeds, run the per-Issue lifecycle defined by the `linear-agent` workflow **in the current session** — never by spawning `linear-agent` (or any named worker) via the `Agent` tool. The lifecycle culminates in a team-first flow (`lisa-implement`), and that flow can only create its agent team from the lead session: a spawned teammate cannot add named teammates (Claude teams are flat), so dispatching the build into a subagent strands `lisa-implement` without its team and collapses the build into a single inline worker. Concretely:

1. **Run the gates in-session** via their skills, exactly as `linear-agent.md` defines them and with all of its gating behaviors intact:
   - `lisa-linear-read-issue` — the full Issue graph (mandatory; never ad-hoc reads)
   - `lisa-linear-verify` — pre-flight quality gate, including the draft-then-block procedure on FAIL
   - `lisa-ticket-triage` — analytical triage gate (a `BLOCKED` verdict stops the cycle with findings posted)
   - Intent determination from the type label
2. **Dispatch the flow in-session:** when the gates pass, invoke the lifecycle skill via the Skill tool — `lisa-implement <ISSUE-ID>` for Build / Fix / Improve / Investigate-Only (or `lisa-plan` for an Epic-equivalent) — passing the full context bundle from the read step. Hand that bundle over by file, not by text: before invoking `lisa-implement`, run the ignore guard below, then write the bundle verbatim to persist it at the git-ignored `.lisa/work-item-context.md` of this worktree — always overwriting the file with this cycle's bundle, never reusing one an earlier item left behind — and pass only `caller_bundle_path=<absolute path>` in the invocation. `lisa-implement`'s input-resolver keeps that file as the base instead of re-summarizing it, so every comment reaches the agents doing the work. Bundle text, and any credential value in it, never appears in a spawn prompt, task description, or Skill argument — only its path. **Ignore guard before any write.** A host can receive these skills before its shipped `.gitignore` entry, so prove the path is ignored first, from the worktree root: `git check-ignore -q .lisa/work-item-context.md || printf '%s\n' '.lisa/work-item-context.md' >> "$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)/info/exclude"`, then re-run `git check-ignore -q .lisa/work-item-context.md`. If it is still not ignored, stop and report — do not write the bundle. If an `.easignore` exists and `grep -qxF '.lisa/work-item-context.md' .easignore` fails, stop and report instead of writing: EAS uploads read `.easignore`, which is derived from `.gitignore`, not from `info/exclude`. **When 3b classified this Issue `rejection-reclaim`, the context bundle passed to `lisa-implement` MUST include the rejection evidence summary** (what was rejected, the defect the QA comment named, the approach named as wrong) — reuse the evidence already read in 3b, do not fetch it twice — so the plan can address it per `rejection-detection`; absence of evidence never blocks. `lisa-implement`'s own orchestration preamble then creates the per-item agent team (input-resolver, Roster Decision, specialist fanout) exactly as a direct invocation would.
3. **Milestone sync and evidence** (`lisa-linear-sync`, `lisa-linear-evidence`) happen at the milestones the `linear-agent` workflow defines, within the dispatched flow.

If you are somehow running this skill as a spawned teammate inside an existing team (nested misrouting — Intake keeps this chain in the lead session), do NOT run the lifecycle inline and do NOT spawn named peers. Return this payload to the lead so the lead session can run this Phase 3c in-session:

```json
{
  "type": "delegation-request",
  "phase": "linear-build-intake 3c",
  "workItem": "<ISSUE-ID>",
  "context": {
    "claimedLabel": "$CLAIMED",
    "doneResolution": "Resolve $DONE from the PR base branch per this skill's Workflow resolution section"
  },
  "onSuccess": "Confirm the returned PR is merged, then apply Phase 3d and Phase 3d.1",
  "onBlockedOrError": "Leave the Issue where the lifecycle left it and record the surfaced outcome"
}
```

The lifecycle run returns one of the following outcomes; resume this scanner with it:
- **Success** — the build flow completed and a PR exists; evidence posted. The PR may already be **merged** or still **open** (auto-merge enabled, awaiting checks/merge). "Success" means the build work is sound — it does **not** assert the change reached an environment. The env transition in 3d gates on the PR actually being merged; an open PR does not advance the Issue to a `done` env status.
- **Blocked by linear-verify pre-flight gate** — the pre-flight gate (linear-agent workflow step 2) transitions to `$BLOCKED` and assigns to creator. Let it stand. Record and move on.
- **Duplicate already fixed** — `lisa-ticket-triage` returned `DUPLICATE_ALREADY_FIXED` with a canonical Issue reference and empirical base-branch evidence. Post the triage finding, ensure the native `duplicates <canonical>` relationship exists when Linear exposes it (otherwise leave an explicit relation/comment reference), move the Issue to the configured canceled-as-duplicate state (falling back to the terminal `$DONE` state only when that is the project's duplicate-close convention), and do not open a PR. If the canonical fix is merged but not yet on the production branch, the close comment must say the production error can recur until the canonical Issue promotes and that recurrence is tracked by the canonical Issue; do not reopen this duplicate for that recurrence.
- **Blocked by ticket-triage ambiguities** — triage posts findings and the lifecycle stops. The Issue stays at `$CLAIMED`. Surface to human; do not auto-transition. Record under "Errors".
- **Errored** — exception, missing config, etc. Leave at `$CLAIMED`. Record with exception summary.

#### 3c.1 Close duplicate already fixed

Run this only when the returned triage verdict is exactly `DUPLICATE_ALREADY_FIXED`.

1. Verify the structured result includes a canonical Issue reference, the canonical PR/commit, and empirical evidence that the canonical fix is present on the base branch. If any piece is missing, treat the outcome as Held instead of closing.
2. Post or preserve the triage-finding comment that explains why this Issue is a duplicate and names the canonical Issue.
3. Ensure a native `duplicates <canonical>` relationship exists when Linear exposes one; if this workspace cannot create that relationship, leave an explicit relation/comment reference and record the limitation in the summary.
4. Resolve the terminal `$DONE` value exactly as in Phase 3d. For env-keyed workflows, duplicate closeout uses the production/final done state, not an intermediate `On Dev`/`On Stg` waypoint.
5. Move the Issue from `$CLAIMED` to the configured canceled-as-duplicate state. If no duplicate/canceled state is configured, use the terminal `$DONE` state only when that is the project's duplicate-close convention; otherwise record setup as an Error rather than inventing a state.
6. Post a close comment naming the canonical Issue, PR/commit, and base-branch evidence.

If the canonical fix is merged but not yet present on the production branch, append the production-promotion caveat to the close comment: the production error can recur until the canonical Issue promotes, and recurrence is tracked by the canonical Issue rather than by reopening this duplicate.

This path is distinct from `BLOCKED`: ambiguity, open blockers, and duplicate-of-open findings remain held for human action and must not be auto-closed.

#### 3c.2 Confirm applied learnings (last_confirmed bump)

Run this at the end of 3c, after the lifecycle outcome is recorded and before 3d. It keeps the decay pass safe: a genuinely useful learning that keeps applying stays fresh, while dead weight ages out.

1. **Identify which learnings demonstrably applied.** Resolve the learnings surface with `resolveProjectLearningsFile` and parse it with `parseLearningsFile` from `@codyswann/lisa/learnings` (never hardcode the path; a missing file skips this step silently). An entry counts as applied ONLY when its rule was explicitly cited or observably followed in this claim's plan, diff, or review responses — the plan quotes the rule or its id, or the diff does specifically what the rule mandates where the default behavior would have differed. **Presence in context is NOT application**: entries reach a session only through the contract's bounded projection, so counting "it was projected" would confirm every projected entry on every claim and defeat decay entirely. A run that produced no plan or diff has nothing to confirm.
2. **Bump each applied entry exactly once** via the surgical writer:

   ```bash
   node -e 'import("@codyswann/lisa/learnings").then(async m => { const r = await m.confirmLearningEntry(process.cwd(), process.argv[1], new Date().toISOString().slice(0, 10)); console.log(JSON.stringify(r)); }).catch(error => { console.log(JSON.stringify({ status: "error", id: process.argv[1], message: String(error) })); })' <entry-id> || true
   ```

   The invocation is failure-safe by construction: a rejected import or write resolves to a structured `error` result instead of a crash, and the trailing `|| true` absorbs any remaining non-zero exit (missing `node`, unresolvable package). Record an `error` or non-zero outcome in the cycle summary and continue — the bump must never abort the lifecycle.

   `confirmLearningEntry` advances ONLY `last_confirmed` — rule text, why, provenance, `first_learned`, and confidence are untouched — and is idempotent within a claim: a repeat same-date bump returns `unchanged`, so an entry that applied repeatedly during one claim is bumped once, not once per application.
3. **Never block on it.** A failed bump, an unwritable file, or a `not-found` result (the entry was pruned) is recorded under the cycle summary and the claim proceeds — shipping the Issue always outranks confirming a learning about it.

#### 3d. Transition to $DONE (only after the PR is merged)

A `done` env state (`On Dev`, `On Stg`, or the terminal value) asserts that the code has actually reached that environment. Never set it for a PR that is merely open: auto-merge can be blocked indefinitely (a required rebase / `BEHIND` branch, failing checks, an unaddressed review), and the change may never land. Moving an Issue to `On Stg` on an open PR makes it *claim* a deploy that never happened. Transition only after confirming the PR merged.

If the lifecycle run returned Success:
1. **Confirm the PR merged.** Read the live state of the Issue's PR — `gh pr view <pr> --json state,mergedAt,mergeStateStatus,url`:
   - **Merged** (`state == MERGED`) → proceed to resolve and apply `$DONE` below. Where the env deploy is observable (a deploy workflow run / deployment status keyed to the merged-into branch via `deploy.branches`), run the **promotion-completeness gate** (resolution step 5) across **every** env branch at or below the resolved env — not only the merged-into branch. A rung counts only when the merge commit is an ancestor of its branch **and** that branch's most recent deploy concluded `success`; a still-running or otherwise unconcluded deploy is treated like an open PR (leave at `$CLAIMED`), and a rung whose deploy concluded anything but `success` is recorded as an Error. Where a branch exposes no deploy surface at all, ancestry alone decides that rung.
   - **Open / not yet merged** → do **not** transition. The build is sound but the change has reached no environment yet. Record the Issue under **"PR open — awaiting merge"** in the summary (with the PR URL and its `mergeStateStatus`), leave it at `$CLAIMED`, and stop. A later `lisa-repair-intake` cycle drives the open PR to merge — re-syncing a `BEHIND` branch so the already-enabled auto-merge can land, or surfacing a real blocker — and, once merged, applies this same env transition. Do **not** comment "Build complete" or change the native state.
   - **Closed without merging** → record an Error (the PR was abandoned unmerged); leave the Issue at `$CLAIMED`.
2. Resolve `$DONE` for this issue's PR base branch using the Workflow resolution algorithm above, **including its promotion-completeness cap** (step 5): the value written is the highest contiguously reached rung at or below the resolved env, never the resolved env by itself. If env can't be resolved and `done` is env-keyed, record an Error and skip this transition — never guess.
3. Determine whether `$DONE` is the true terminal done value per the `leaf-only-lifecycle` rule's Terminal native closure section:
   - If `linear.workflow.done` is a string, that state is terminal.
   - If `linear.workflow.done` is an object, only the production/final environment value is terminal (default: `Done`). Intermediate env states such as `On Dev` and `On Stg` are not terminal — they are typed `started`, so the Issue correctly stays open and on the board.
   - If the project uses a different final environment name, resolve it from the configured deployment topology; if ambiguous, record an Error and do not change the native state.
4. Transition via `lisa-linear-access operation: save-issue lifecycle_role: done env: <resolved-env-key>` (from `$CLAIMED`, or from `$REVIEW` if `lisa-linear-evidence` already moved it forward). Pass `env` **only where `linear.workflow.done` is a map of environments**: there the key is mandatory and the access layer refuses a bare `done`; where `done` is a single state the project has no environment rungs and the layer refuses a stray key just as firmly. Either way the layer resolves `$DONE` itself rather than accepting the ID this phase computed.
5. **That single write IS the native closure** when `$DONE` is terminal — there is no second step, because the role and the native state are now the same field. When `$DONE` is an intermediate env (`On Dev` / `On Stg`), the state is typed `started`, so the Issue stays open and active by construction rather than by a compensating repair. If a git automation or magic word has already front-run the Issue into a `completed` state while the resolved env is intermediate, reconcile it back via `lisa-linear-sync` Phase 4b — and treat a recurrence as a setup defect, since `/lisa:setup:linear` offers to remove the `merge → Done` automation that causes it.
6. Post a `[claude-build-intake]` comment: `"Build complete. PR <URL> merged. Transitioned to $DONE."`

For any non-Success outcome, do NOT transition. The Issue sits where the lifecycle left it — humans take it from there.

#### 3d.1 Roll up the parent chain (forward rollup)

Run this **only after a successful `$DONE` transition in 3d**. This is the **forward** arm of the `leaf-only-lifecycle` rule's *"rollup is evaluated whenever a child transitions"* requirement: a leaf reaching `$DONE` may complete its parent Issue, which may in turn complete its Project. Without this step a fully-built parent stays open until the recovery `lisa-repair-intake` cron happens to run.

1. Resolve the Issue's parent using the same hierarchy `lisa-linear-read-issue` uses — native parentage: a sub-issue's `parentId`, and Project membership via `projectId` for the Epic-equivalent. If the Issue has no parent, skip — nothing to roll up.
2. Walk **up the ancestor chain bottom-up** (sub-issue → parent Issue → Project): for each ancestor invoke `lisa-linear-sync <ANCESTOR-ID> --rollup`. That skill derives the ancestor's lifecycle **state** from its children per `leaf-only-lifecycle`, applies it via `lisa-linear-access operation: save-issue` only when it differs (never `$READY` — a parent is never rolled into the human-owned ready lane), and because the terminal `$DONE` state is itself typed `completed`, reaching it *is* the native closure. It is idempotent and safe-defaults (suggests, does not guess) when the rolled state is ambiguous.
3. Stop walking up when an ancestor has no parent, or when `--rollup` reports no change. Record each rolled-up ancestor and its derived state in the summary.

This does not re-implement the state machine — it delegates to `lisa-linear-sync --rollup`, the single rollup implementation `lisa-repair-intake` also uses, so the forward and recovery paths can never drift. Children closed **outside** this flow are not observed here; `lisa-repair-intake` remains the recovery net for those.

#### 3e. Stop

Stop immediately after the first claimed, skipped, blocked, held, or errored Issue. Later scheduler invocations process the remaining ready Issues.

## Idempotency & safety

- **Leaf-only claim gate runs first**: Phase 3a classifies each candidate before any claim; a container with open child work (or a childless Epic) is skipped/safe-blocked, never claimed (the `leaf-only-lifecycle` rule's claim-time arm). The safe-block comment is idempotent — a re-entrant cycle does not re-post it.
- **Claim-first ordering**: `$CLAIMED` set BEFORE the lifecycle dispatch — no double-pickup.
- **No writes outside the lifecycle**: this skill only moves the Issue between `$READY`, `$CLAIMED` and `$DONE`. Every label change, and every state change outside those three, is owned by the per-Issue lifecycle or `lisa-linear-evidence`.
- **Duplicate terminal exception**: `DUPLICATE_ALREADY_FIXED` is the only triage outcome that may close a claimed Issue without a PR from this cycle. It must include a canonical Issue reference and empirical base-branch evidence, and it closes through the configured duplicate/canceled terminal path rather than as completed build work.
- **Terminal native closure**: satisfied by the `$DONE` transition itself. Only the production/final `done` state is typed `completed`; intermediate env states are `started` and keep the Issue open.
- **One item per cycle**: per-Issue exceptions are caught and recorded, then the cycle exits. The scheduler owns retrying or moving on to the next ready item.
- **Single cycle per team**: do not run two concurrent cycles against the same team — concurrent claims could race.
- **Single-lane invariant**: an Issue holds exactly one workflow state, so the old "exactly one `status:*` label" check is now enforced by Linear's data model rather than by this skill. That is a real gain — the two-labels-at-once corruption it guarded against is unrepresentable.
- **Never pick an arbitrary env for `$DONE`**. If `done` is a map and env is ambiguous, fail loudly.

## Adoption (one-time per team)

Before this skill can run against a Linear team, the team must have the build-queue workflow states. Run `/lisa:setup:linear`, which resolves each role and offers to create what is missing — a stock Linear team ships `Todo`, `In Progress`, `In Review` and `Done` but **not** `Ready`, `Blocked`, `On Dev` or `On Stg`.

1. Ensure states exist for every role configured in `linear.workflow`. Required roles have no resolver default and must be bound explicitly; optional roles may be omitted. Note `ready` is a DEDICATED state, not Linear's default `Todo` — mapping it to the default would make every untouched backlog item claimable. Override any role name in config rather than renaming to match.
2. Move Issues to `$READY` when they are ready for development.
3. Reserve `$CLAIMED`, `$REVIEW`, `$DONE` for Lisa — humans should not set them manually except to recover from an error.
4. Remove the team's `merge → Done` git automation. It is a second writer that jumps an Issue to terminal on a `dev` merge, skipping the env rungs; `/lisa:setup:linear` detects and offers to delete it.

If the team hasn't adopted these states, the first run exits with an adoption hint.

## Rules

- **Claim leaves only.** Per the `leaf-only-lifecycle` rule, never claim a container — an Issue with open child work, or a childless Epic — even if it sits in the build-ready state. Skip or safe-block it (Phase 3a); never silently implement a container.
- Never transition an Issue the cycle didn't claim. The `$CLAIMED` transition is the signature of cycle ownership.
- Never do build work directly from this scanner — the per-Issue lifecycle (the `linear-agent` workflow culminating in `lisa-implement`) owns it. And never spawn that lifecycle as a subagent; run it in-session per Phase 3c so `lisa-implement` can create its agent team.
- Never auto-transition past `$DONE`. Downstream states are owned by QA / product / a future verification-intake skill.
- Never use a `completed`-typed state for an intermediate env rung. `On Dev` / `On Stg` (or configured equivalents) must be typed `started`; completion happens only at the terminal `done` value.
- If the Issue has no Validation Journey or no sign-in credentials in its description, the pre-flight verify gate will catch it and transition it to `$BLOCKED` — don't try to fix the Issue from here.
- On any unexpected outcome from the lifecycle run (a state it doesn't claim, missing PR URL on success, etc.), record as Error and surface — never assume.
- Never pick an arbitrary env for `$DONE` resolution. If `done` is a map and env is ambiguous, fail loudly.
