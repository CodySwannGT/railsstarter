# Notion Access: $ARGUMENTS

Single chokepoint for all Notion operations. Routes each op to a substrate, enforces connection match, returns structured result. Caller skills (`notion-*`) MUST go through this — they MUST NOT call the Notion REST API or any `mcp__*notion*` tools directly.

## Invocation contract

```text
operation: read-page         id: <uuid>
operation: create-page       parent_database_id: <uuid> properties: {...} [children: [...]]  # create a new page (e.g. a PRD row) in a database; children is optional — omit to create a page without initial block content
operation: write-page        payload: {...}        # update page properties
operation: archive-page      id: <uuid>
operation: query-database    id: <uuid> filter: {...} sort: {...}
operation: read-database     id: <uuid>
operation: append-blocks     page_id: <uuid> children: [...]
operation: search            query: "..." [filter: { object: "page" }]
operation: list-users
operation: get-self
```

The skill returns either the structured operation result (JSON) or an error message prefixed with `Error:` and a remediation hint.

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Substrate selection (per operation)

Read config:

```bash
WORKSPACE=$(jq -r '.notion.workspaceId // empty' .lisa.config.json)
DB_ID=$(jq -r '.notion.prdDatabaseId // empty' .lisa.config.json)
[ -z "$WORKSPACE" ] && { echo "Error: notion.workspaceId not set. Run /lisa:setup:notion." >&2; exit 1; }
[ -z "$DB_ID" ]     && { echo "Error: notion.prdDatabaseId not set. Run /lisa:setup:notion." >&2; exit 1; }
```

Probe each tier in order; the first that's ready AND identity-matches is the substrate for this operation. The ordering is the shared `credential-substrate-precedence` contract — the configured-provider token substrate leads, the interactive MCP is the fallback — not a Notion-local choice. Identity-match is verified before any operation; substrates authenticated as a different workspace are skipped, not used, at **every** tier.

```bash
substrate=""

# Tier 1: curl + API token — the configured-provider substrate, resolved through
# lisa-secrets-access. Leads because it is identical on a laptop, in CI, in a cloud
# routine, and in a subagent, and because its workspace binding travels with the
# request instead of coming from ambient browser-session state.
read_notion_token() {
  local workspace="$1"
  [ -n "$NOTION_API_TOKEN" ] && { echo "$NOTION_API_TOKEN"; return; }
  local slug=$(echo "$workspace" | tr '[:upper:]-' '[:lower:]_')
  local varname="NOTION_API_TOKEN_${slug}"
  [ -n "${!varname}" ] && { echo "${!varname}"; return; }
  # Preferred path: the single secrets chokepoint. It owns the one-store rule
  # and the surface ladder, so anything it can answer must not be read out of an
  # OS keychain here — a second reader is how the same credential ends up living
  # in two places and drifting.
  #
  # Ordered across trusted machine-managed substrates, ending at the installed
  # package. Checkout-local paths are deliberately absent: a familiar generated
  # destination is still repository-controlled executable code. The plugin
  # rungs are the floor: `resolve-secret.mjs` ships beside this skill, so a rung
  # pointing at it is reachable from anywhere the plugin itself is installed.
  # Without one, a consumer repository that vendors none of the leading paths
  # never reaches a resolver at all — the ladder exits without having asked
  # anything, which is what pushed agents into improvising their own credential
  # lookups. This LADDER is identical in every skill that resolves a credential
  # and `credential-resolver-ladder` fails if any copy diverges. Only what
  # happens AFTER the ladder may differ between them.
  # Execute only machine-managed plugin/package resolvers. Checkout-local
  # candidates are repository-controlled code, not trusted merely by path.

  done

  #
  # This rung is REMOVED ON 2026-11-01 — a dated migration ramp, not a standing
  # exemption (see credential-substrate-precedence, "Legacy OS-keychain fallback
  # — removal date"). A keychain entry is machine-local ambient state no headless
  # surface can reach, so a project resting on it has no working tier 1 in cron,

  # NOTION_API_TOKEN through the chokepoint instead.

Error: no Notion access substrate available for workspace '$WORKSPACE'.

Attempted (in credential-substrate-precedence order):
  curl   — no NOTION_API_TOKEN found for $WORKSPACE (env, slug-suffixed env, or keychain) OR token belongs to a different workspace

Remediation paths (the first is the contract's primary path):

1. Provision an internal-integration API token — works headless, in CI, and in
   multi-workspace setups, and is the substrate this project resolves first.

     Run /lisa:setup:notion — guided flow with clipboard-piped keychain store.

2. Install the Notion MCP plugin (local scope — per-developer, gitignored).
   The supported fallback when no credentials provider is configured.

   Run in your terminal:

     jq '.enabledPlugins["notion@claude-plugins-official"] = true' \\
       .claude/settings.local.json 2>/dev/null > /tmp/s && \\
       mv /tmp/s .claude/settings.local.json || \\
       echo '{"enabledPlugins":{"notion@claude-plugins-official":true}}' > .claude/settings.local.json

   Then restart Claude Code (or run /restart-mcp) to load the plugin, and
   invoke 'mcp__plugin_notion_notion__authenticate' to complete OAuth.
   Also share the configured prdDatabaseId with the integration via
   the page's '•••' menu → Connections.

EOF
  exit 1
fi
```

### Step 2 — Connection-match assertion

The substrate selection in Step 1 already verifies identity. This step is the explicit re-assertion before any operation runs — defensive in case substrate state changed since selection. For the curl tier, re-validate token-to-workspace pairing if more than a few minutes elapsed.

The workspace identifier stored in config is whatever stable string the user picked at setup time — typically `bot.workspace_name` (human-readable) for simplicity. If the workspace has been renamed in Notion, `setup-notion` re-detects and re-stores; the access skill surfaces the mismatch instead of silently authing as the wrong workspace.

### Step 3 — Operation dispatch

When `$substrate=mcp`, route through Notion MCP tools. When `$substrate=curl`, hit the Notion REST API directly. All curl calls use `https://api.notion.com/v1/<path>`, `Notion-Version: 2022-06-28`, `Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN`.

Substrate columns: try the column matching `$substrate` first. If that column is `—` for the requested operation (no adapter), fall through to the other substrate if it's also available. If neither has an adapter, the operation is unsupported.

| Operation | MCP adapter | curl adapter |
|---|---|---|
| **Pages** | | |
| `read-page id:<I>` | `mcp__claude_ai_Notion__notion-fetch` | `GET /v1/pages/<I>` |
| `create-page parent_database_id:<D> properties:<P> [children:<arr>]` | `mcp__claude_ai_Notion__notion-create-pages` | `POST /v1/pages` body `{ "parent": { "database_id": "<D>" }, "properties": <P>, "children": <arr?> }` (children optional per Notion API) |
| `write-page payload:<P>` | `mcp__claude_ai_Notion__notion-update-page` | `PATCH /v1/pages/<I>` body `{ "properties": {...}, "archived": true/false }` |
| `archive-page id:<I>` | `mcp__claude_ai_Notion__notion-update-page` (with `archived: true`) | `PATCH /v1/pages/<I>` body `{ "archived": true }` |
| `append-blocks page_id:<P> children:<arr>` | (no direct equivalent) | `PATCH /v1/blocks/<P>/children` body `{ "children": <arr> }` |
| **Databases** | | |
| `read-database id:<I>` | `mcp__claude_ai_Notion__notion-fetch` | `GET /v1/databases/<I>` |
| `query-database id:<I> filter:<F> sort:<S>` | `mcp__claude_ai_Notion__notion-search` (with collection scope) | `POST /v1/databases/<I>/query` body `{ "filter": <F>, "sorts": <S>, "page_size": <N> }` |
| **Comments** | | |
| `list-comments block_id:<I>` | (MCP lacks a generic list-comments tool) | `GET /v1/comments?block_id=<I>` |
| `create-comment page_id:<I> rich_text:<arr>` | `mcp__claude_ai_Notion__notion-create-comment` (page-level) | `POST /v1/comments` body `{ "parent": { "page_id": "<I>" }, "rich_text": <arr> }` |
| `create-comment-on-block block_id:<I> rich_text:<arr>` | `mcp__claude_ai_Notion__notion-create-comment` (with block anchor) | `POST /v1/comments` body `{ "parent": { "block_id": "<I>" }, "rich_text": <arr> }` |
| **Search & users** | | |
| `search query:<Q> [filter:<F>]` | `mcp__claude_ai_Notion__notion-search` | `POST /v1/search` body `{ "query": "<Q>", "filter": <F or null> }` |
| `list-users` | — | `GET /v1/users` |
| `get-self` | — | `GET /v1/users/me` |

Operations not in this table are unsupported — add an adapter row before invoking. Adapters MUST return parsed JSON; never raw HTTP responses.

### Step 4 — Return result

Wrap the JSON response in a `<result>` block for caller parsing. On HTTP non-2xx, prefix the error message with `Error:` and surface the HTTP status code plus Notion's response body verbatim.

```bash
exec_op() {
  local method="$1" path="$2" body="${3:-}"
  local args=( -s -X "$method"
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
    -H "Notion-Version: 2022-06-28" )
  [ -n "$body" ] && args+=( -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data-binary "$body" )
  local code=$(curl "${args[@]}" -o /tmp/notion-resp -w "%{http_code}" \
    "https://api.notion.com/v1${path}")
  if [ "${code:0:1}" != "2" ]; then
    echo "Error: Notion API $method $path returned HTTP $code" >&2
    cat /tmp/notion-resp >&2
    return 1
  fi
  cat /tmp/notion-resp
}
```

## Invariants

- Caller skills never call `curl https://api.notion.com/...` or any `mcp__*notion*` tool directly. They invoke this skill via the Skill tool with an operation name and arguments.
- Substrate is selected per skill invocation following the tier ladder defined by the shared `credential-substrate-precedence` contract — internal-integration token first, Notion MCP as fallback. The first tier that's available AND identity-matches `notion.workspaceId` wins. Do not restate or locally override the ordering here.
- The Notion MCP stays a first-class fallback, not a removed tier: it is the substrate whenever no token is configured, the operation has no curl adapter, or the Notion API is failing.
- The connection-match check is mandatory at every tier. Skipping it (because "the user obviously meant this workspace") is forbidden — silent cross-workspace operations are exactly the multi-account hazard this design exists to prevent. A present-but-wrong token fails the gate rather than deferring to an MCP authenticated somewhere else.
- API tokens never mutate. If the configured workspace's token is wrong or missing, fail loudly and tell the user to run `/lisa:setup:notion`.
- `Notion-Version` is pinned to `2022-06-28` — the version every existing notion-* skill targets. Bumping it is a coordinated change across the access skill and all callers.

## Headless behavior

In a headless / non-interactive context (no TTY, `CI=true`, or `-p` mode), the MCP tier is unavailable (its OAuth flow needs a browser) and the ladder collapses to curl + `NOTION_API_TOKEN` — which is already tier 1 interactively. That is the point of the ordering: headless and interactive sessions take the **same primary path**, so a credential problem reproduces on a laptop instead of only in cron (`credential-substrate-precedence`, "headless parity"). Same skill code runs identically; only the availability of the fallback changes.

## Per-page sharing prerequisite

Notion integrations only see pages that have been **explicitly shared** with them. If `read-page` or `query-database` returns a 404 or `object_not_found` error and the configured workspace is correct, the cause is almost always that the page/database wasn't shared with the integration. Surface this in the error message:

> Page <id> not visible to the integration. Open the page in Notion → "..." menu → Connections → add the lisa integration.

Do not paper over with a retry. Sharing is a one-time human action per database (or per page if the user prefers page-level sharing); failures here mean the user needs to act.
