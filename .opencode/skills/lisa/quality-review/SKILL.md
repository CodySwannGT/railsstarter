# Quality Review

Review code quality for changed files. Explain all findings in plain English as if speaking to someone with no programming background.

## Review Checklist

For each changed file, evaluate:

1. **Correctness** -- Does the code do what the task says? Logic errors, off-by-one mistakes, missing edge cases?
2. **Coding philosophy** -- Immutability patterns (no `let`, no mutations, functional transformations)? Correct function structure (variables, side effects, return)?
3. **Test coverage** -- Tests present? Testing behavior, not implementation details? Edge cases covered?
4. **Documentation** -- JSDoc on new functions explaining "why"? Preambles on new files?
5. **Code clarity** -- Readable variable names? Unnecessary complexity? Could a new team member understand this?

## Output Format

Rank findings by severity:

### Critical (must fix before merge)
Broken logic or violates hard project rules.

### Warning (should fix)
Could cause problems later or reduce maintainability.

### Suggestion (nice to have)
Minor improvements, not blocking.

## Finding Format

For each finding:

- **What** -- Plain English description, no jargon
- **Why** -- What could go wrong? Concrete examples
- **Where** -- File path and line number
- **Fix** -- Specific, actionable suggestion

### Example

> **What:** The function changes the original list instead of creating a new one.
> **Why:** Other code using that list could see unexpected changes, causing hard-to-track bugs.
> **Where:** `src/utils/transform.ts:42`
> **Fix:** Use `[...items].sort()` instead of `items.sort()` to create a copy first.

## Rules

- Run `bun run test` to confirm tests pass
- Run the task's proof command to confirm the implementation works
- Never approve code with failing tests
- If no issues found, say so clearly -- do not invent problems
