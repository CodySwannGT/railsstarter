# Create JIRA Issues from $ARGUMENTS

All Atlassian operations in this skill go through `lisa-atlassian-access`. Do not call MCP tools or `acli` directly.

Analyze the provided file(s) and plan a JIRA hierarchy. **This skill plans structure only — every individual ticket write is delegated to `lisa-jira-write-ticket`.** Do not invoke `lisa-atlassian-access` write operations directly from this skill — all writes go through `lisa-jira-write-ticket`.

## Process

1. **Analyze**: Read $ARGUMENTS to understand scope.
2. **Extract source artifacts**: invoke the `lisa-tracker-source-artifacts` skill, then enumerate every external URL, embed, attachment, or example payload in the input and classify each by domain per its rules. Build the `artifacts` map (one entry per artifact: url, title, domain, source page, classification reason). See "Source Artifacts" below.
3. **Walk the live product** (when applicable): if the work touches existing user-facing surfaces, invoke the `lisa-product-walkthrough` skill to capture current behavior, design-vs-product divergence, and reuse candidates. Skip when the work is purely backend or affects a screen that does not yet exist. See "Live Product Walkthrough" below.
4. **Determine structure**:
   - Epic needed if: multiple features, major changes, >3 related files
   - Direct tasks if: bug fix, single file, minor change
5. **Plan hierarchy**:
   ```text
   Epic → User Story → Tasks (test, implement, document, cleanup)
   ```
6. **Delegate every write to `lisa-jira-write-ticket`** in dependency order (epic first, then stories with the epic as parent, then sub-tasks with their story as parent). Pass the artifacts (filtered by domain per `lisa-tracker-source-artifacts` inheritance rules) and the walkthrough findings (under `## Current Product`). See "Delegation to jira-write-ticket" below.
7. **Run the artifact preservation gate** (`lisa-tracker-source-artifacts` §8): after all writes complete, build the preservation matrix and verify every extracted artifact is reachable from the created tickets. Fail loudly if anything was dropped.

## Mandatory for Every Code Issue

**Test-First**: Write tests before implementation
**Quality Gates**: All tests/checks must pass, no SonarCloud violations
**Documentation**: Check existing, update/create new, remove obsolete
**Cleanup**: Remove temporary code, scripts, dev configs

## Validation Journey

Tickets that change runtime behavior should include a `Validation Journey` section in the description. This section is consumed by the `lisa-jira-journey` skill to automate verification.

### When to Include

Include a Validation Journey when the ticket involves:
- API endpoint changes (new, modified, or removed routes)
- Database schema changes (migrations, new columns, index changes)
- Background job or queue processing changes
- Library or utility function changes that affect exports
- Security fixes (authentication, authorization, input validation)
- Performance-critical changes requiring measurement

### When to Skip

Skip the Validation Journey for:
- Documentation-only changes
- Config-only changes (env vars, CI/CD, feature flags with no code)
- Type-definition-only changes (interfaces, types, no runtime effect)

### How to Write

Design the journey based on the **change type**. The agent executing the journey determines how to verify each step using patterns from the project's `verfication.md`. Place `[EVIDENCE: name]` markers at key verification points.

Add this section to the ticket description:

```text
h2. Validation Journey

h3. Prerequisites
- Local dev server running
- Database accessible
- Required environment variables set

h3. Steps
1. Verify the current state before changes
2. Apply the change (run migration, deploy, etc.)
3. Verify the expected new state [EVIDENCE: state-after-change]
4. Test error/edge cases [EVIDENCE: error-handling]
5. Verify rollback or cleanup if applicable [EVIDENCE: rollback-check]

h3. Assertions
- Describe what must be true after verification
- Each assertion is verified against the captured evidence
```

### Guidelines

1. **Steps must be concrete and verifiable** — "Run `curl -s localhost:3000/health`" not "Check the API"
2. **Evidence markers at verification points** — Place `[EVIDENCE: name]` at states that prove the change works. Use descriptive kebab-case names (e.g., `api-response`, `schema-check`, `rate-limit-hit`)
3. **Include 2-5 evidence markers** — Enough to prove the change works across happy path and error cases
4. **Assertions are testable statements** — "Health check returns 200 with status ok" not "API works"
5. **Prerequisites include environment setup** — Database connection, env vars, running services

## Source Artifacts

If $ARGUMENTS includes (or references) any external artifact — PRD, design doc, Figma URL, Lovable prototype, Loom walkthrough, screenshot, example payload — those references MUST be preserved as remote links on the created tickets. Silent artifact loss is the single most common quality failure in this pipeline.

**Invoke the `lisa-tracker-source-artifacts` skill** for the canonical rules: domains, per-tool classification (Figma `/proto/` vs design, Lovable, Loom, screenshots), source precedence, conflict handling under `## Open Questions`, inheritance from epic → story → sub-task, and the existing-component reuse expectation. Do not restate the rules here — invoke the skill so any rule change propagates uniformly.

When delegating actual writes to `lisa-jira-write-ticket`, pass the extracted artifact list so its Phase 4c (Remote Links) step can attach them.

## Live Product Walkthrough

When the work touches existing user-facing surfaces, invoke the `lisa-product-walkthrough` skill before drafting tickets. The walkthrough findings (current behavior, design-vs-product divergence, reuse candidates, behavioral surprises) become inputs to the ticket plan and surface under `## Current Product` on the resulting tickets. Skip only when the work is purely backend or affects a screen that does not yet exist.

## Issue Requirements

Each issue must clearly communicate to:

- **Coding Assistants**: Implementation requirements
- **Developers**: Technical approach
- **Stakeholders**: Business value

Default project: from jira-cli config (override via arguments)
Exclude unless requested: migration plans, performance tests

## Delegation to jira-write-ticket

**Mandatory.** Every ticket created by this skill MUST go through `lisa-jira-write-ticket`. This skill never invokes `lisa-atlassian-access` write operations itself — all writes are delegated so the gate cannot be bypassed.

`lisa-jira-write-ticket` enforces things this skill does not, and which determine ticket quality:
- 3-audience description (Context / Technical Approach / Acceptance Criteria)
- Gherkin acceptance criteria
- Epic parent validation (non-bug, non-epic types)
- Explicit link discovery (`blocks` / `is blocked by` / `relates to` / `duplicates` / `clones`)
- Remote links (PRs, Confluence, dashboards)
- Single-repo scope check for Bug / Task / Sub-task
- Sign-in account and target environment recorded in description
- Post-create verification

### Invocation order

Tickets must be created in parent-before-child order so each child can be passed its parent key:

1. Invoke `lisa-jira-write-ticket` for the epic. Capture the returned key.
2. For each story, invoke `lisa-jira-write-ticket` with the epic key as the epic parent. Capture each story key.
3. For each sub-task, invoke `lisa-jira-write-ticket` with the parent story key.

### What to pass to each invocation

For every delegated write, pass:
- The summary, issue type, project key, and priority you decided
- The 3-section description body you drafted (Context / Technical Approach / Acceptance Criteria)
- Gherkin acceptance criteria
- Parent key (epic key for stories; story key for sub-tasks)
- The artifact list extracted in "Source Artifacts", filtered by domain per the inheritance rules — `lisa-jira-write-ticket` Phase 4c attaches them as remote links
- For tickets that change runtime behavior: the Validation Journey draft (or instruct it to call `lisa-jira-add-journey` after create)

### What this skill is responsible for

This skill owns:
- Deciding the *shape* of the hierarchy (what's an epic vs. story vs. sub-task)
- Drafting the description body and acceptance criteria from the input
- Extracting and classifying source artifacts
- Threading parent keys through subsequent writes
- Running the Phase 5.5-style preservation check after all writes complete

It does not own the actual JIRA write — that's `lisa-jira-write-ticket`'s job.
