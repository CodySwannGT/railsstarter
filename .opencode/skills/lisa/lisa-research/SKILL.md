name: lisa-research
description: "Research a problem space and create a PRD in the configured PRD source. Investigates the codebase, defines user flows, assesses technical feasibility, synthesizes the spec, then creates it in the source (Notion / Confluence / GitHub / Linear) via lisa:prd-source-write — no loose document. prd_ready=true creates it prd-ready for auto-pickup by lisa:intake; default is draft for the Plan flow / human review."

## Lisa Command Compatibility

- Original Claude command: `/lisa:research`
- OpenCode invocation: `$lisa-research` or a plain-English request that matches this skill.
- Treat the user's surrounding request as the command arguments.
- Claude argument hint: `<problem-statement-or-feature-idea> [prd_ready=true|false]`

Use the /lisa:research skill to research the problem and create a PRD in the configured source — in draft state by default, or prd-ready when prd_ready=true. Use the user's surrounding request as this command's arguments.
