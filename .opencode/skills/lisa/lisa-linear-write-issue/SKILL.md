# Write Linear Work Item: $ARGUMENTS

On runtimes without the rule tree (Antigravity), read **Worth doing** in `lisa-track` for the same value and decline policy.

## Before creating incidental work

Apply `do-it-now`'s **Worth doing** guidance before drafting a new incidental item. Decline low-value observations without writing a ticket or requesting a human gate; report the reason briefly to the caller. A complete spec is not evidence of value. This does not cancel explicit user requests or accepted requirements. Honor prior Not planned decisions through `rejection-detection`, including legacy issues without markers. Accepted work continues through the existing validation and readiness contract below.

## Human-gate release authorization

A release requires a trusted human author, not just matching comment text. Follow
`ready-role-filing` — **Human-gate release authorization**: preserve tracker-supplied comment
author IDs and bot metadata, resolve `trustedHumanActorIds` only from an explicit user instruction
or existing human-authored trusted project policy, and pass it with structured `comments` to every
hold classifier, reconciliation, normalization and release planner. Never derive trust from the
comment body, a display name, the actor's own assertion, or an automation posting on its own behalf.
Missing policy, missing/unreadable author identity, raw body strings, untrusted actors and known bots
cannot discharge a hold. Keep the item held and report the missing authorization; do not silently
replace these inputs with an empty history or an inferred allowlist. Authorized matching releases
continue through the existing path and never override an independently declared caller hold.


Create or update a Linear work item — Project (for Epics), Issue (for Stories), or sub-Issue (for Sub-tasks) — with all required relationships, metadata, and quality gates. Every section below is mandatory. Thin items are rejected.

Repository name for scoped comments: `basename $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)`.

## Configuration

This skill reads configuration from `.lisa.config.json` (with `.lisa.config.local.json` overriding per key). Required keys:

- `linear.workspace` — Linear workspace slug
- `linear.teamKey` — Linear team key (e.g. `ENG`); the team owns the destination items

If either is missing, stop and report — never invent values.

## Polymorphic dispatch

Linear's data model maps Epic / Story / Sub-task to **different entity types**. This skill dispatches on `issue_type`:

| `issue_type` | Linear entity | MCP write tool | Parent field |
|--------------|---------------|----------------|--------------|
| `Epic` | **Project** | `lisa-linear-access operation: save-project` | (none — Projects are top-level within a team) |
| `Story` / `Task` / `Improvement` | **Issue** | `lisa-linear-access operation: save-issue` | `projectId` (the Epic Project) |
| `Sub-task` | **sub-Issue** | `lisa-linear-access operation: save-issue` | `parentId` (the Story Issue) |
| `Bug` | **Issue** | `lisa-linear-access operation: save-issue` | `projectId` if part of an Epic; else top-level |
| `Spike` | **Issue** | `lisa-linear-access operation: save-issue` | `projectId` if part of an Epic; else top-level |

The build lifecycle uses native **workflow states** (`Ready`, `In Progress`, `Blocked`, `On Dev`, `On Stg`, `Done`, plus an optional review state a project may bind), resolved per role from `linear.workflow` — see "Why Linear uses states, not labels" in `config-resolution`. A new **leaf** work unit is created in the configured `ready` state only on explicit `build_ready: true`; omitted or `false` leaves it in the team's default backlog state, and a container is never put in `ready` at all (see the Build-ready control input below).

For direct API or bespoke script writes, the [bespoke-path contract](#writing-by-a-bespoke-path-your-own-script-direct-api-or-graphql) still requires pre-write validation and post-write verification.

## Phase 1 — Resolve Intent

Determine from `$ARGUMENTS` and context whether this is a CREATE or UPDATE:

- **CREATE**: no existing identifier provided.
- **UPDATE**: identifier provided (`<TEAM>-<n>` for Issue, project slug + short-id for Project) — call `/linear-read-issue <ref>` first to load the full current state. Never overwrite without reading.

Resolve the team ID for `linear.teamKey` via `lisa-linear-access operation: list-teams({query: <teamKey>})`. Cache it.

## Phase 2 — Gather Required Inputs

Required fields (stop and ask if missing — never invent values):

| Field | Required For | Notes |
|-------|--------------|-------|
| `team_key` | CREATE | From `linear.teamKey` config; required for both Project and Issue creation |
| `issue_type` | CREATE | One of: Epic, Story, Task, Bug, Spike, Sub-task, Improvement |
| Summary | CREATE, UPDATE | One line, imperative voice, under 100 chars |
| Description | CREATE, UPDATE | Multi-section markdown — see Phase 3 |
| Project parent (for Story / Task / Bug / Spike / Improvement when part of an Epic) | non-Epic, non-Sub-task in Epic context | Linear Project ID — the Epic |
| Sub-task parent | Sub-task | Linear Issue ID — the Story |
| Priority | CREATE | Native Linear priority: 0=No priority, 1=Urgent, 2=High, 3=Medium, 4=Low |
| Acceptance criteria | Story, Task, Bug, Sub-task, Improvement | Gherkin — see Phase 3 |
| Validation Journey | Runtime-behavior changes | Delegate to `/linear-add-journey` |
| Target backend environment | Runtime-behavior changes | For every work type, use an exact `deploy.branches` key when an environment is known. Human: bare key or `Confirmed: <env>`. Automation: `Inferred: <env> — evidence: <title\|body\|reproduction\|hostname>`, `Assumption: <env> — remote default branch <branch>` for a unique reverse-map, or `Assumption: remote default branch <branch>` otherwise. Human confirmation replaces an automated annotation with the bare key or `Confirmed: <env>`. |
| Sign-in account / credentials | Items that touch authenticated surfaces | Name the account (or source — 1Password item, env var, seeded fixture) and role; recorded in description. Omit when sign-in is not required. |
| Single-repo scope | Bug, Task, Sub-task | These types MUST cover one repo only. If the work crosses repos, split it before creating. Epic / Spike / Story may span repos. |
| Source Requirement | PRD-sourced Issues (`prd_source` provided) | `## Source Requirement` with PRD link + verbatim requirement quote(s) — see Phase 3; enforced at every level, sub-issues included. |

Optional but recommended: assignee, estimate (story points), labels, project milestone (fix-version equivalent), cycle.

## Phase 3 — Description Quality

Linear descriptions are markdown (NOT Jira wiki markup — no `h2.` headings, use `##` instead). The description MUST address three audiences. Reject and rewrite if any are missing.

```markdown
## Source Requirement
[Required whenever the Issue originates from a PRD (the caller passes
 `prd_source`). Answers "why was this done?" — cite the PRD and quote the
 requirement(s) VERBATIM, never paraphrased:
 - **PRD**: <PRD title + link> §"<section heading>"
 - **Requirement (R3)**: "<verbatim requirement text from the PRD>"
 One Requirement line per satisfied requirement. Derived / cross-cutting
 work that traces to no single requirement uses the supporting form:
 "Derived work supporting R3, R7 — no single PRD section." Close with:
 "This Issue exists to satisfy the quoted requirement. If implementation
 scope drifts from the quoted text, the PRD is the authority — raise the
 conflict rather than silently reinterpreting it." Omit the section only
 for ad-hoc Issues with no PRD lineage.]

## Context / Business Value
[Why this matters. Stakeholder-facing. Concrete user impact or business outcome.
 Link to the originating Slack thread, Notion doc, incident, or customer report.]

## Technical Approach
[Developer-facing. Integration points, impacted modules, data model implications,
 relevant tradeoffs. Not a full design doc — a pointer for someone picking it up.]

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Given <precondition>
   When <action>
   Then <observable outcome>
2. Given <precondition>
   When <action>
   Then <observable outcome>

## Out of Scope
[Explicit list of what this item does NOT cover. Forces scope discipline.]

## Target Backend Environment
[ALWAYS required on a leaf — the SECTION is unconditional, only its
 VALUE is conditional. It is where `runtime_behavior_change` is
 persisted, so omitting it records nothing rather than recording "no".
 When the item changes runtime behavior, use an exact
 `deploy.branches` key. A human-confirmed value is a bare key or
 `Confirmed: <env>`. An automated evidence write is
 `Inferred: <env> — evidence: <title|body|reproduction|hostname>`; an automated
 generic default is `Assumption: <env> — remote default branch <branch>`.
 Without a unique reverse-map use `Assumption: remote default branch <branch>`.
 Human confirmation replaces the automated annotation with a bare key or
 `Confirmed: <env>`. ALWAYS render this section — it is where
 `runtime_behavior_change` is persisted, and an absent section reads as
 *underivable*, not exempt. Work that changes no runtime behavior declares the
 exemption in place of an environment: `None — no runtime behavior change:
 doc-only` (or `config-only` / `type-only`). A Project/container declares
 `None — container: state rolls up from children`. Visible prose, not an HTML
 comment, for the same reason the Branch Plan provenance line is: a marker that
 survives in only one representation cannot be a vendor-neutral discriminator,
 and every tracker this contract binds stores its body in some rich-text or
 structured form that need not preserve HTML comments. A declaration a reader
 can see is one every backend can store. See the `derived-branch-plan` rule.]

## Branch Plan
[GENERATED, never hand-authored. Render only when the item has a Target
 Backend Environment; omit entirely when `runtime_behavior_change = false`
 (doc-only / config-only / type-only) or for a Project/container — absence is
 correct there. Derive per the `derived-branch-plan` rule: resolve the
 environment, map it forward through `.lisa.config.json` `deploy.branches`,
 and prove the branch exists on the remote. Do not accept caller-supplied
 branches; recompute them. Exactly three lines:
   Branch from: <branch>
   PR into: <branch>
   Derived from: Target Backend Environment <env> via .lisa.config.json deploy.branches
 Both fields name the same branch by construction. A missing, ambiguous, or
 non-unique mapping, or a branch absent from the remote, STOPS the write —
 never default to `main` or the remote default to keep the write alive.]

## Sign-in Required
[Include this section ONLY if the work touches authenticated surfaces.
 Specify: the account/role to sign in as, where to get the credentials
 (1Password item name, env var, seeded fixture), and any MFA/SSO notes.
 Omit the section entirely when sign-in is not required.]

## Repository
[Required for Bug / Task / Sub-task. Name the single repo this item covers.
 If the work spans repos, this issue type is wrong — split into per-repo
 Tasks/Sub-tasks under a parent Story or Epic.]

## Validation Journey
[Delegate to /linear-add-journey if the item changes runtime behavior.
 Skip only for doc-only, config-only, or type-only items. Cross-work-item
 evidence pointers use `[EVIDENCE-REF: <work-item-ref> | <artifact-type>: <kebab-case-name>]`;
 they never replace this item's local S14 marker.]
```

Rules:
- PRD-sourced Issues (caller passed `prd_source`) MUST carry the Source Requirement section with verbatim quotes — paraphrases are rejected (validator gate S16). This applies at every level, sub-issues included: a leaf claimed in isolation must explain its own "why".
- Every acceptance criterion uses Given/When/Then. No vague "should work" language.
- Every criterion is independently verifiable (UI, API, data, or performance check).
- If the item is a Bug, include reproduction steps, expected vs. actual behavior, and environment.
- If the item is a Spike, include the question being answered and the definition of done (decision doc, prototype, or findings).
- If sign-in is required, the implementer must be able to sign in from the description alone — never assume they will guess the account or hunt for credentials.

## Phase 4 — Relationship Discovery (Mandatory)

Before creating or updating, find candidate relationships. Do NOT skip — this is the step agents most often omit.

### 4a. Project Parent (Epic-equivalent)

If the item is **not an Epic** and **not a top-level Bug/Spike**, it MUST have a parent context:

- **Story / Task / Improvement** → must have a `projectId` (the Epic Project) set.
- **Sub-task** → must have a `parentId` (the Story Issue) set.

If the parent is explicitly provided, use it. Otherwise:

1. Search active Projects in the team:
   ```text
   lisa-linear-access operation: list-projects({team: <teamKey>, state: ["backlog", "planned", "started"]})
   ```
   Match on keywords from the summary and description.
2. If no matching Project exists, stop and ask the human to create or pick one. Do NOT orphan the item.

### 4b. Related Items

Relationship discovery is **mandatory** on every create and every update — never declare "no related work" without doing both searches below and recording their outcomes on the item.

**Search 1: local git history** (catches PRs / commits that touched the same area but were never linked):

```bash
git log --all --oneline --grep="<keyword>"
git log --all --oneline -- <path-or-glob>
git log --since=90.days --oneline -- <path-or-glob>
```

If the git search surfaces a PR or commit that relates to this work, capture the PR URL — it becomes a remote link (Phase 4c) and may also point to a sibling item worth linking.

**Search 2: Linear MCP** (catches open and recently-closed items):

```text
# Open items in the same Project
lisa-linear-access operation: list-issues({project: <projectId>, state_type: ["unstarted", "started"]})

# Open items with overlapping keywords (workspace-wide)
lisa-linear-access operation: list-issues({query: "<keyword>", state_type: ["unstarted", "started"]})

# Items with shared labels
lisa-linear-access operation: list-issues({label: "<label>", updatedAt: ">-30d"})

# Recently closed items in the same Project
lisa-linear-access operation: list-issues({project: <projectId>, state_type: ["completed", "canceled"], updatedAt: ">-30d"})
```

**Record the outcome.** Add a `## Relationship Search` subsection (or a comment if updating) listing the queries you ran and what they returned. If the searches yielded nothing, write that explicitly — "Searched git history for `<keywords>` and Linear for project=`X`, label=`Y`; no related work found." An item with zero relations and no documented search is rejected.

For each candidate, classify the relationship:

| Relation Type | When to Use |
|---------------|-------------|
| `blocks` | This item must ship before the linked item can proceed |
| `blocked_by` | The linked item must ship before this one can proceed |
| `relates_to` | Shared context, no ordering constraint |
| `duplicates` | This item already exists — close one as duplicate |

Linear native relations are set on the Issue via `save_issue`'s `relations` field (or via a paired `save_issue_relation` call if available in the MCP). For Project-level (Epic) relationships, capture them in the description under `## Related Projects` since Linear doesn't model relations between Projects natively.

**Adding a relation to an already-linked pair may be a REPLACE, not an add.** Reported measured twice against the raw `issueRelationCreate` mutation: creating a `blocks` edge between two issues already carrying a `related` edge converted that edge in place — the source issue's outgoing relation count did not grow (CodySwannGT/lisa#3605). Relationship discovery is mandatory on the UPDATE path as well as creation, so this skill's own contract routinely points it at pairs that already have edges.

So on an update, read the pair's existing relations before writing one. Where an edge already exists and differs in type, surface it and let a human decide rather than writing over it — **an inherited relation is not a verified one**, and rewriting it silently removes the only moment anyone would check what it meant.

**The true undo is delete plus re-create with the original type.** A single delete removes the link entirely and does not restore what was there before, so any runbook recording "undo = delete relation X" has written down a plan that loses the prior relationship.

**Marked UNVERIFIED.** The observations were against the raw mutation; whether the MCP's `relations` field diffs before writing has not been tested, and testing it means writing a relation to a live workspace. Note that this does not make Lisa safe by default: `lisa-linear-access` resolves `LINEAR_API_KEY` + raw GraphQL as **tier 1, ahead of the MCP**, so the normal autonomous path is the one the observations were made against.

### 4c. Remote Links

Identify and attach (Linear stores attachments / links on the Issue or in description body):

- GitHub PRs, branches, or commits related to this work
- Confluence pages (design docs, RFCs, runbooks)
- Dashboards (Grafana, Datadog, Sentry issue)
- Incident items (PagerDuty, Statuspage)
- **Source artifacts from the originating PRD / parent Project**: classify and inherit per the rules in `lisa-tracker-source-artifacts` (invoke that skill if you haven't loaded the rules in this session). Enumerate the parent Project's links and inherit the ones whose domain matches this item's scope (UI → `ui-design` + `ux-flow`; backend → `data`; infra → `ops`; always inherit `reference`). Never assume a developer will walk up to the Project to find design context — attach it here.

If the item was generated from a PRD (by `lisa-notion-to-tracker` or similar) and the parent Project has no source artifacts, surface that as a smell and ask whether artifacts were missed during extraction before proceeding.

### 4d. Source Precedence (must appear on the item)

Source precedence rules and cross-axis conflict handling are defined in `lisa-tracker-source-artifacts` §3 and §4. When an item carries both design artifacts and a description, record the precedence explicitly in the description (under Technical Approach or a dedicated `## Source Precedence` subsection) so the implementer doesn't silently reconcile conflicts. Cross-axis conflicts go under `## Open Questions` as BLOCKER items.

For UI-touching items, include the existing-component reuse expectation per `lisa-tracker-source-artifacts` §7.

### 4e. Live Product Walkthrough Findings (UI-touching items)

If the item modifies an existing user-facing surface, a `lisa-product-walkthrough` should already have been run upstream. Inherit its findings under a `## Current Product` subsection in the description so the implementer sees what's shipped today before changing it. If the upstream skill skipped the walkthrough but this item clearly modifies an existing surface, invoke `lisa-product-walkthrough` here before proceeding.

## Phase 5 — Set Metadata

Before create/update, verify each field is populated where applicable:

- **Workflow state**: set the resolved `ready` state (`linear.workflow.ready`, default `Ready`) on a new **leaf** work unit (Bug / Task / Sub-task / Improvement with no child work) per `leaf-only-lifecycle`, **only on explicit `build_ready: true`** (see the Build-ready control input below). A container (Epic Project / Story with sub-issues / Spike) is never put in the build-ready state.
- **Labels**: taxonomy only — `type:<Kind>`, `repo:<name>`, `component:<name>`. Lifecycle is **not** a label on Linear; do not add `status:*` labels.
- **Native priority field**: 0–4 per Linear's scale; explicit, not "unset".
- **Native estimate**: per Linear's team-configured estimate scale (often 0–8 Fibonacci); skip for Epic / Spike.
- **ProjectMilestone**: when the team uses dated milestones, set the milestone on the Project (Epic) or on the Issue (when an Issue belongs to a milestone).
- **Cycle**: only if actively in a cycle.
- **Assignee**: leave unset if unknown rather than auto-assigning.

For Bug / Task / Sub-task, ensure the summary is prefixed with `[<repo-name>]`.

### Build-ready control input (`build_ready`)

`build_ready` is a write-control input governed by the `ready-role-filing` rule — cite that slug for the full contract; do not restate its per-vendor normalization table here. It decides whether a **leaf** work unit is created **in the resolved `ready` workflow state**. It never overrides `leaf-only-lifecycle` — a container is never stamped build-ready regardless of `build_ready`. "Not build-ready" is not a special state: the Issue is simply left in the team's default backlog/unstarted state, which a human can promote later. This mirrors `lisa-jira-write-ticket`, because Linear is a state-driven tracker like JIRA, not a label-driven one like GitHub.

- **Omitted** → **not build-ready**: the leaf is left in the team's default backlog state. Ready is an explicit claim, never a vendor default. **This is a breaking change** — Linear previously created a leaf directly in the `ready` state on omission, so a caller that relied on that must now pass `build_ready: true`.
- **`build_ready: false`** → create the leaf **without** the `ready` state, leaving it in the team's default backlog state so it waits for a human to review and promote it into the queue.
- **`build_ready: true`** → declare `lifecycle_role: ready` so the access layer resolves `.linear.workflow.ready` and places the leaf there, and `lisa-intake` / `lisa-linear-build-intake` auto-picks it up. Best-effort **for the lane, never for the guard**: an access-layer refusal (`ready` unbound, absent from the team, ambiguous) is fail-closed and is never worked around here — surface its message verbatim, do not fail the write, leave the Issue in its default state and record the reason. The Issue is still created; what is refused is the unproven lane placement, which is the safe half to lose.

**A filing with neither is an incomplete handoff.** A leaf that is not build-ready must carry an explicit `human_gate: "<why a human must judge this first>"`; nothing in the ready lane means nothing ever claims it. When `human_gate` is supplied, stamp the hold on the Issue so it is auditable — a visible line plus the verbatim marker:

```text
Held for a human product call: <reason>.
<!-- [lisa-human-gate] reason=<short-slug> -->
```

**Stamp both surfaces, not just the marker.** Also apply the configured `human_needed` marker
label (`linear.labels.build.human_needed`, default `human-needed`) to the Issue, via the Issue's labels (create it via `create_issue_label` if absent). The marker in the body and the label say the same thing,
and a filing that carries only one of them is a **half-armed gate**: sweeps that read the body
honour it, and sweeps that read labels do not. That is not hypothetical — the repair sweep that
normalizes items carrying no lifecycle label keys on the *absence* of `human_needed`, so a
marker-only hold was its population by construction and got promoted into the build queue (#3805).
The marker remains the authoritative declaration; the label is what makes the hold visible to a
person scanning a board and to any path that has not yet been routed through the shared reader.
If the label does not exist in the tracker, create it, or record that it could not be applied and
proceed — the marker still holds. Never file the label *instead of* the marker.

**Every marker reader must consult comments.** Use `classifyReadyCandidate` with labels, body, comments and the configured human-needed label, then `planHumanGateRelease` for any release actions. A historical body marker alone is not an active hold after its matching release; unreadable comments leave a hold in place.

**Write a `reason=` the release can name.** The hold's reason is not decoration: a hold ends when a
`[lisa-human-gate-release]` comment repeating that same `reason=` is recorded on the item by an authorized human, and the
next intake sweep then takes the marker label off and puts the item back in the build-ready role on
its own. Matching is per-reason so that a hold declared *after* an earlier release is not born
discharged. A keyless hold is legal and is discharged by a keyless release; a hold whose reason is a
paragraph is legal and nobody will reproduce it. Prefer a short slug the person answering it can
retype. Do **not** instruct anyone to delete the marker from the description to lift the hold — the
only body write available is a whole-body replacement, so that asks them to rewrite the whole record
to clear one line, which is why answered holds accumulated instead of being lifted
(CodySwannGT/lisa#3852). The marker stays as history; the release is recorded beside it.

If a leaf arrives with `build_ready` omitted or `false` **and** no `human_gate`, do not create it: report the incomplete handoff and name both ways to resolve it (`build_ready: true`, or a `human_gate` reason). Containers are exempt — their state rolls up from children, so they need neither.

## Phase 5.5 — Validate (Pre-write Gate)

Before any write, invoke `lisa-linear-validate-issue` with the full proposed spec assembled from Phases 2 / 3 / 4 / 5. Pass it as a YAML block per the `lisa-linear-validate-issue` schema, including `runtime_behavior_change`, `authenticated_surface`, and `artifacts_attached` flags so the right gates run.

The validator is the **single source of truth** for what makes a valid Linear work item. The same gates are used by `lisa-linear-to-tracker` dry-run, by `lisa-linear-verify` post-write, and here. Do not re-implement gate logic in this skill.

If the validator reports `FAIL`:
- Surface the failure list and the per-gate remediation to the user.
- Do NOT proceed to Phase 6. Fix the spec (or stop and ask the human) and re-run validation.
- Never call `lisa-linear-access operation: save-project` or `lisa-linear-access operation: save-issue` while the validator's verdict is FAIL.

If the validator reports `PASS`, continue to Phase 6.

## Phase 6 — Create or Update

### CREATE — Epic (Project)

1. Resolve any required Project labels (`prd-ticketed`, etc.) via `lisa-linear-access operation: list-project-labels` (create via `lisa-linear-access operation: create-project-label` if missing).
2. Call `lisa-linear-access operation: save-project` with: `name` (summary), `description` (markdown), `teamIds: [<teamId>]`, `labelIds`, `priority` (Linear Project priority is also 0–4), `state` (default `backlog`), milestones if dated.
3. Capture the returned Project ID and slug — Phase 4 children need these.
4. If the Project is the parent for downstream Stories, record the ID for `lisa-linear-to-tracker` Phase 4 to use.

### CREATE — Story / Task / Bug / Spike / Improvement (Issue with projectId)

1. Resolve any required Issue labels (`type:<Kind>`, `repo:<name>`, `component:<name>`) via `lisa-linear-access operation: list-issue-labels` (create via `lisa-linear-access operation: create-issue-label` if missing). Separately, place a **leaf** work unit in the `ready` lane by passing `lifecycle_role: ready` on the create call below — and only on **explicit `build_ready: true`**, per the Build-ready control input below. Omit the role for a container, and for a leaf whose `build_ready` is `false` or omitted, which then waits in the team's default backlog state for a human to promote it. Ready is an explicit claim, never an omission's default. Never resolve a state ID here and pass it as `stateId`: the access layer resolves the configured `ready` state itself and refuses anything else.
2. Call `lisa-linear-access operation: save-issue` with: `team` (teamId), `title` (summary), `description` (markdown), `projectId` (the Epic Project), `priority` (0–4), `estimate`, `labelIds`, `assignee` if known.
3. Capture the returned identifier (e.g. `ENG-123`) — Phase 4 sub-tasks need it as `parentId`.
4. Add relationships from Phase 4b via `save_issue` (relations field) or paired relation calls.
5. If the item changes runtime behavior, invoke `lisa-linear-add-journey` to append the Validation Journey section.

### CREATE — Sub-task (Issue with parentId)

1. Resolve labels as above. A Sub-task is a **leaf**, so the same ready-lane rule applies: pass `lifecycle_role: ready` on the create call below only on explicit `build_ready: true`, and omit it otherwise. Never resolve a state ID here.
2. Call `lisa-linear-access operation: save-issue` with: `team` (teamId), `title` (`[<repo>] <summary>` prefix is mandatory), `description` (markdown), `parentId` (the Story Issue ID), `projectId` (inherit from parent), `priority`, `estimate`, `labelIds`, plus `lifecycle_role: ready` when `build_ready` is explicitly `true`.
3. Capture identifier.
4. Add relationships via Phase 4b.

### UPDATE

1. Call `lisa-linear-access operation: save-project` or `lisa-linear-access operation: save-issue` with **only the fields being changed**. Do NOT resend fields that weren't in the change set — Linear treats the call as a full overwrite of the listed fields.
2. Preserve description sections you are not editing — re-read via `/linear-read-issue` first, including any existing canonical managed `## Lisa Usage` section unless the caller intentionally supplied an updated canonical section. Use the shared `lisa-usage-accounting` serializer/merge path rather than freehand edits to ledger rows.

## Phase 7 — Verify

Call the `lisa-linear-verify` skill on the resulting item. `lisa-linear-verify` fetches the live item and runs `lisa-linear-validate-issue` against it — same gates as Phase 5.5, but applied to what Linear actually stored. If it reports failures, fix them before returning. Do not report success on an item that fails verify.

## Phase 8 — Announce

Post a creation comment via `lisa-linear-access operation: save-comment` — `issue_id:<ID>` for an Issue, `project_id:<ID>` for an Epic-level announcement, which goes on the Project itself. Never create an Issue to carry a Project's announcement. The comment contains:

- `[<repo>]` prefix if the item is repo-scoped
- Who the item is assigned to (if known)
- The relationships that were set (`blocks`, `blocked_by`, `relates_to`) with Linear identifiers
- Any remote PRs attached

Skip this step only on UPDATE when no material change was made.

## Writing by a bespoke path (your own script, direct API or GraphQL)

Nothing here stops a consumer from writing to Linear through the Linear GraphQL API directly, a direct API call, or your own script, and nothing should
try to — a script that owns the credential plumbing is often the only practical transport.
**The transport is not the gate.** A bespoke write path still owes both halves of the quality
gate this skill runs, and owes them explicitly, because no phase of this flow will ever run
for it.

A bespoke script's own read-back does not discharge either obligation. Re-reading the work item
and confirming Linear stored what was sent **proves transport, not quality**: it shows the
fields round-tripped and says nothing about whether what was sent clears a single gate. An
agent that reads `VERIFIED` out of such a script has been told the work item was checked when it
was not. Measured once, on one work item, on 2026-09-03 (CodySwannGT/lisa#3663): a local
script's read-back was clean on every field, and the work item then failed gates S5, S9 and S18
when the validator was run against it by hand.

What a bespoke write path still owes — the same two checks, invoked by hand:

1. **Pre-write validate**, the obligation Phase 5.5 discharges here. Invoke `lisa-linear-validate-issue` via
   the Skill tool with the proposed spec as a YAML block **before** writing. Never write on a
   `FAIL` verdict.
2. **Post-write verify**, the obligation Phase 7 discharges here. Invoke `lisa-linear-verify` via the
   Skill tool with the identifier of the work item you just wrote — or `lisa-linear-validate-issue` directly in
   identifier mode, which fetches and validates the live state. Never report success on a
   `FAIL` verdict.

Both run standalone against an existing live work item; `lisa-linear-validate-issue` documents the copy-pasteable
invocation under its standalone entry point.

**Three outcomes, never two.** `PASS`, `FAIL` and *could not validate* are distinct results.
If the validator did not run to a verdict — the skill was unavailable, a credential was
missing, the work item could not be fetched — that is **not** a pass. Report it as unvalidated and
say why. Collapsing "could not validate" into "validated" is the same misreading as trusting
a read-back.

**These are skills, not scripts.** `lisa-linear-validate-issue` and `lisa-linear-verify` are plugin-resident and invoked
through the Skill tool. They are **not** expected to appear in any repository's `scripts/`
directory, and their absence from one is not evidence that the capability is missing —
searching the repository you happen to be standing in is the wrong search.

## Rules

- Never create a non-Epic, non-top-level item without a parent context (Project for Stories, parentId for Sub-tasks).
- Never skip relationship discovery — both the git history search AND the Linear MCP search must run, and their outcomes must be recorded on the item. "None found" is acceptable only when it's documented.
- Never create a Bug, Task, or Sub-task that spans multiple repos. Split it before creating.
- Never include a runtime-behavior item without a target backend environment, and never include an authenticated-surface item without sign-in credentials in the description.
- Never invent custom field values. If the team requires a field you don't have, stop and ask.
- Never overwrite a description without reading the current version first.
- Preserve an existing canonical `## Lisa Usage` section on update; never append a second usage
  section or silently drop ledger rows.
- All Linear writes go through this skill so best practices are enforced uniformly. Downstream skills (e.g. `lisa-linear-create`) should delegate here rather than calling the MCP write tools directly.
- The gate logic (what makes a valid item) lives in `lisa-linear-validate-issue`, NOT in this skill. This skill calls the validator at Phase 5.5 (pre-write) and Phase 7 (via `lisa-linear-verify` post-write). When a gate needs to change, change it in `lisa-linear-validate-issue` — every caller picks it up automatically.
- This skill is the destination of the `lisa-tracker-write` shim when `tracker = "linear"`. Vendor-neutral callers (`notion-to-tracker`, `confluence-to-tracker`, `linear-to-tracker`, `github-to-tracker`) MUST go through `lisa-tracker-write`, not call this skill directly.
