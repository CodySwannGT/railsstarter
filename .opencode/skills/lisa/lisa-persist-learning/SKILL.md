# Persist Learning

Route ONE candidate learning through the judgment gate and act on the verdict. Candidate: $ARGUMENTS

Most candidates are dropped — that is the gate working, not a failure. Nothing is ever silent (every drop leaves a visible note), and no learning content ever reaches the learnings surface outside a pull request.

On runtimes without the rule tree (Antigravity), read **Worth doing** in `lisa-track` for the same value and decline policy.

## Candidate Input

Accept the candidate as JSON or `key=value` fields:

- `rule` — the proposed learning (must fit the executable contract: ≤240 chars, ≤2 lines)
- `why` — the causal claim
- `provenance` — stable refs (issues/PRs/commits/comments), ≤20
- `evidence_links` — concrete evidence refs available for citation
- `scope_hint` — `project` | `upstream` (a hint; the judge decides)
- `triggering_issue` — the issue/work item whose failure produced this candidate (required)
- `fingerprint` — optional; computed below when absent

## Phase 0 — Fingerprint (stable dedupe key)

Every workflow marker and branch below keys off this occurrence fingerprint. It is separate from the ledger entry fingerprint, which all writers compute with `learningFingerprint(rule)` from `@codyswann/lisa/learnings`:

```text
fingerprint = "sll4-" + first 12 hex chars of sha1(normalized_rule + "\n" + triggering_issue)
normalized_rule = rule lowercased, all whitespace runs collapsed to single spaces, trimmed
```

```bash
NORM=$(printf '%s' "$RULE" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | tr -s '[:space:]' ' ' | sed 's/^ *//; s/ *$//')
FP="sll4-$(printf '%s\n%s' "$NORM" "$TRIGGERING_ISSUE" | shasum -a 1 | cut -c1-12)"
```

(Use `sha1sum` where `shasum` is unavailable.) The same rule for the same triggering issue always produces the same fingerprint, so re-runs dedupe instead of duplicating comments, PRs, or branches.

## Phase 1 — Judge (mandatory, never skipped)

Invoke the `learning-judge` agent (via the Agent/Task tool with `subagent_type: "learning-judge"` — the same invoke pattern the gardener uses for the `skill-evaluator` ladder router) with the full candidate including the fingerprint. It returns a verdict: `classification`, `cited_evidence[]`, `rationale`, `confidence` (durable only), `disposition`.

**Respect the verdict — do not override it.** Never re-run the judge hoping for a different answer, and never persist anything the judge did not classify `durable-learning`.

## Phase 2 — Route by disposition

All issue/PR comments below follow the marker-dedupe discipline from `lisa-github-write-prd` Phase 2, each with its own producer tag: match on the **marker, never the title or text**; **exactly one marker per body**; **never write a markerless body** (it breaks all future dedupe); include the eventual-consistency guard — when the `gh` search index is stale, also enumerate the bodies directly (`gh issue view <n> --json comments --jq '.comments[].body'` or `gh pr list --json number,body`) and grep for the marker before deciding to create.

### `drop` (classification `one-off` or `misunderstanding/spec-gap`)

Post **one** comment on the triggering issue and write **nothing** — zero bytes — to the learnings surface (not a stub, not a placeholder):

```markdown
<!-- [lisa-learning-drop] key=<fingerprint> -->
Dropped (<classification> — <plain-language gloss>): <reason>.
```

The note is one line naming the classification (with its fixed plain-language gloss) and the reason, readable by a non-technical operator. Use exactly these glosses per class:

| Classification | Gloss |
|----------------|-------|
| `one-off` | a one-time fluke, not a recurring pattern |
| `misunderstanding/spec-gap` | traced to an unclear requirement, not a durable lesson |
| `lisa-upstream` | root cause suspected in Lisa; routed for upstream attribution |

(A `lisa-upstream` classification never produces a drop note — it routes through the `handoff-upstream` flow below, whose step-1 note uses this pre-attribution wording because filing only happens after attribution confirms the Lisa surface.) Dedupe before posting: if any comment on the triggering issue already carries `[lisa-learning-drop] key=<fingerprint>`, do not post again — report the existing note.

### `handoff-upstream` (classification `lisa-upstream`)

This disposition completes the SLL-5 loop (#1583): on an accepted worthwhile Lisa-attributed failure the upstream Lisa ticket is filed **automatically**. Filing lives here — not in `lisa-attribute-failure` — because that skill is deliberately read-only (doctor delegates to it inside its own read-only contract), while this skill already owns exactly the verdict's side effects and the marker-dedupe discipline. Never persist a local rule for a Lisa-attributed failure; the host project's only durable trace is the brief linking note in step 6.

First apply `do-it-now`'s **Worth doing** guidance. Attribution establishes ownership, not value. Decline low-value additional hardening in the current summary without filing, persisting a rule, or asking a human; otherwise continue below. Before creating an upstream issue, consult `rejection-detection` for open and closed matches, including legacy unmarked declines.

1. **Post the handoff marker** on the triggering issue (same one-comment marker dedupe; the marker key is unchanged). The visible line must not claim a filing that has not happened yet — attribution and filing come after this step:

   ```markdown
   <!-- [lisa-learning-upstream-handoff] key=<fingerprint> -->
   Candidate routed for upstream attribution (root cause suspected in Lisa): <reason>.
   ```

2. **Require a confirmed `lisa` verdict from `lisa-attribute-failure` — always.** Run the `lisa-attribute-failure` skill on the failure event before any filing. The judge's `cited_evidence` seeds the event (implicated files, surface in play, failure class) but never substitutes for the verdict — a path or commit reference alone is not attribution. File **only** when the skill returns a conclusive `lisa` verdict that names the Lisa surface with cited evidence. Any other outcome — `ambiguous`, `project`, or a verdict that cannot name a concrete Lisa surface — files **NOTHING** upstream: the candidate stays local and low-confidence, the run summary says attribution was inconclusive, and the step-1 note is resolved with one corrective follow-up comment on the triggering issue (marker-deduped so re-runs never repeat it; the suffix is distinct from the filing-failure marker in step 8 so one outcome never suppresses the other):

   ```markdown
   <!-- [lisa-learning-upstream-handoff] key=<fingerprint>-inconclusive -->
   Attribution was inconclusive — nothing was filed upstream and nothing was persisted locally.
   ```

3. **Derive the root-cause key from the LISA SURFACE, never the host project or the local issue.** Two projects hitting the same Lisa bug MUST collide on the same key — that collision is the design (update, not duplicate):

   ```text
   root-cause-key = <lisa-surface>#<failure-class>
   ```

   - `<lisa-surface>` — the exact public Lisa-relative path of the surface at fault (e.g. `plugins/src/base/skills/lisa-doctor/SKILL.md`, `typescript/copy-overwrite/.github/workflows/quality.yml`). Canonical names, aliases, host paths, and unmanifested paths are prohibited.
   - `<failure-class>` — exactly one exported closed value: `access-control-failure`, `agent-parity-regression`, `configuration-regression`, `data-integrity-failure`, `dependency-regression`, `generated-artifact-regression`, `installation-regression`, `observability-gap`, `pagination-truncation`, `performance-regression`, `public-data-exposure`, `release-regression`, `runtime-regression`, `stale-artifact-overwrite`, `test-coverage-gap`, `validation-gap`, or `workflow-contract-violation`.
   - Normalize: lowercase, trim, collapse every whitespace run to a single `-`. The key must contain no host-project name, no local issue number, and no fingerprint — those vary per project and would defeat fleet-wide dedupe.

4. **Enforce the per-run cap.** Resolve `hardening.maxUpstreamFilingsPerRun` from `.lisa.config.json` (default `5` — a conservative bound modeled on `lisa-repair-intake`'s `max_candidates` precedent). Count every upstream create **and** update this run performs; once the cap is reached, drop the remaining candidates and **note each dropped candidate visibly** (in the run summary, naming its root-cause key) — never queue a spam burst and never drop silently. A later run picks the dropped candidates up idempotently.

5. **Evidence redaction (binding).** The upstream repo is PUBLIC by default (`hardening.upstreamRepo` → `CodySwannGT/lisa`) and this filing runs headless on crons — treat every drafted upstream body and comment as world-readable. The PRIMARY control is the **allowlist projection** in step 6: `bunx @codyswann/lisa file-upstream` calls the sole `buildUpstreamAttributionIssueBody` export from `@codyswann/lisa/learnings`, so content outside its enumerated fields is structurally incapable of reaching the public document. The rules below bind the FIELDS supplied to that command; the closing scan is a defense-in-depth backstop, never the primary control:

   - Quote ONLY Lisa-owned surface text: template/rule/skill/hook excerpts and upstream commit references. The reproduction must be REDACTED — generic placeholders, never the host project's real values.
   - Never paste host environment values, tokens/credentials, connection strings, API keys, PII (names, emails, customer data), or proprietary host code/payloads.
   - The evidence chain names the Lisa surface and the failure class — never project payloads. Keep any host-project issue link only in the private local trace; it is never supplied to or emitted by the public builder.
   - Use only these exact generic placeholders: `<host-project>`, `<env-value>`, `<credential>`, `<connection-string>`, `<pii>`, `<host-payload>`, `<path>`, `<identifier>`. A project-specific placeholder is host prose and must be rejected.
   - **Backstop (defense in depth, never the primary control).** Before filing or commenting, scan the projected document for common secret shapes — `key=value` pairs with high-entropy values, token prefixes (`AKIA`, `ghp_`, `xox`), email addresses — and reject on a match. To strip on match, remove the offending INPUT field and re-run `file-upstream`; never strip or edit the generated output itself. Non-allowlisted fields must reject before filing rather than be silently dropped. When in doubt, leave it out: a thinner upstream document is recoverable; a leaked secret is not.

6. **Dedupe by marker, then file or update.** The upstream marker is:

   ```markdown
   <!-- [lisa-upstream-attribution] key=<root-cause-key> -->
   ```

   Resolve the upstream repo from `.lisa.config.json` `hardening.upstreamRepo` (default `CodySwannGT/lisa`). Search **all issue states** for an existing issue carrying the marker — a closed marker-bearing ticket still owns this root cause, and searching only open issues would mint a duplicate the moment the original closes. Match on the **MARKER, never the title** — with the same eventual-consistency guard as above (`gh issue list -R <upstream> --state all --search '"<marker>" in:body' --json number,state,url`, and when the search index returns nothing, also `gh issue list -R <upstream> --state all --json number,state,body` and grep the bodies for the marker before concluding no ticket exists).

   - **No existing ticket** → compose the body EXCLUSIVELY through the executable builder, then file its stdout verbatim via `lisa-github-write-issue` targeting the upstream repo with the `self-hardening` label and explicit `build_ready: true` (per `ready-role-filing`; the upstream repo runs its own build queue off the ready role, and an omitted flag would strand the hardening ticket there):

     ```bash
     bunx @codyswann/lisa file-upstream --input filing-event.json   # or pipe the JSON on stdin
     ```

     **Never assemble the public body as free-form prose.** Public composition happens through the builder, never by free-form prose assembly. The builder owns the three-audience description and the redacted evidence chain (Lisa-owned text only). Do not hand-write either section, name an affected project in prose, or edit the builder's output after generation. Supply only this JSON shape; host-project issue URLs remain private local-trace data and are never accepted by the public builder:

     ```json
     {
       "documentKind": "issue",
       "lisaSurface": "plugins/src/base/skills/lisa-doctor/SKILL.md",
       "failureClass": "stale-artifact-overwrite",
       "lisaOwnedExcerpts": [
         {
           "file": "plugins/src/base/skills/lisa-doctor/SKILL.md",
           "text": "<verbatim Lisa-owned text>"
         }
       ],
       "upstreamCommitRefs": ["<full 40-character public-origin SHA>"],
       "redactedPlaceholders": ["<host-project>", "<env-value>"]
     }
     ```

     Every excerpt is verified against the installed package's Lisa-owned source and every commit against the public origin. Callers cannot supply a verifier or Lisa root. Anything outside the allowlist is REJECTED by field name with empty stdout and a non-zero exit; fix or remove the offending input field and re-run the command, never route around it. The builder emits **exactly one** dedupe marker; **never write a markerless body** — it permanently breaks all future dedupe.
   - **Existing ticket (open or closed)** → this is a repeat encounter: comment the new occurrence on the existing issue with this project's evidence. The comment is projected through the same builder: run `bunx @codyswann/lisa file-upstream` with the same allowlisted fields plus exactly `"documentKind": "occurrence"` and `"occurrenceFingerprint": "<fingerprint>"`. The supplied fingerprint is only a validated seed: the builder hashes it and emits a different deterministic `sll4-<12 lowercase hex>` marker. Use the marker in the builder's stdout — never the supplied literal — to search existing issue comments for a duplicate, then post stdout verbatim only when that emitted marker is absent. Free-form occurrence prose is prohibited, and post-generation edits are prohibited. Never open a second issue, and never match on the title — evidence compounds on one ticket. When the match is **CLOSED**, still comment the occurrence there and reference it in the local trace instead of filing a duplicate; do not reopen it yourself — recurrence evidence on a closed ticket signals the shipped fix may not cover this case, and reopening is the upstream maintainer's call.

7. **Leave the local trace — a note, never a rule.** Post one follow-up comment on the triggering issue linking the upstream ticket:

   ```markdown
   <!-- [lisa-upstream-filed] key=<fingerprint> -->
   Upstream ticket: <url> (root-cause key `<root-cause-key>`). No local rule persisted — the fix ships fleet-wide through Lisa.
   ```

   The learnings surface gains **no durable local rule** for a Lisa-attributed failure. Agents avoid the trap via the upstream ticket link until the fix ships.

8. **Degrade gracefully.** If filing fails (auth, rate limit, network), report the failure in the run summary and continue shipping the host issue — a later run retries idempotently. Never block the primary build flow. So the step-1 note is not left dangling, post a marker-deduped corrective follow-up on the triggering issue — with its own suffix, distinct from step 2's `-inconclusive`, so an earlier inconclusive note can never suppress a filing-failure note (or vice versa):

   ```markdown
   <!-- [lisa-learning-upstream-handoff] key=<fingerprint>-filing-failed -->
   Upstream filing did not complete — nothing was filed upstream and nothing was persisted locally; a later run retries.
   ```

### `persist` (classification `durable-learning`)

Continue to Phase 3.

## Phase 3 — Persist via PR (durable-learning only)

No learning content is ever committed without a PR — there is no other write path, and the PR must touch **only** the learnings surface (any other changed file is a bug).

1. **PR dedupe.** Search all PRs for the marker `[lisa-learning-pr] key=<fingerprint>` in the body (`gh pr list --state all --search '"<marker>" in:body' --json number,url`), with the stale-index guard above. If one exists, reference it and stop — never open a duplicate.
2. **Resolve the learnings surface path — never hardcode it.** The canonical path is `resolveProjectLearningsFile` from `@codyswann/lisa/learnings`: the machine-managed ledger resolved from `.lisa.config.json` (the `learnings.file` override, else the default `.lisa/PROJECT_LEARNINGS.md` — a cold path, never an auto-loaded rules tree):

   ```bash
   LEARNINGS_FILE=$(node -e 'import("@codyswann/lisa/learnings").then(async m => { const c = await m.readProjectConfig(process.cwd()); console.log(m.resolveProjectLearningsFile(c)); })')
   ```

3. **Consolidation check (mandatory before writing).** Parse the existing entries (`parseLearningsFile` from `@codyswann/lisa/learnings`). First compare `learningFingerprint(existing.rule)` with `learningFingerprint(candidate.rule)`: an equal rule is already captured, even if its legacy id or fingerprint has another prefix. Preserve the stored values, report the existing id, and stop without writing that candidate. Shared evidence alone never makes two rules duplicates. Only otherwise look for related entries (same failure class, overlapping topic, or near-duplicate wording) and write through the executable contract — **never hand-edit the markdown**:
   - **Related entry found** → consolidate with the exact versions returned by the parser: `persistConsolidatedLearning(projectRoot, entry, { supersede: [{ id: <related id>, fingerprint: <related fingerprint> }], onStaleSupersede: targets => report(targets) })`. The writer checks every stamp together inside the lock. If any target is absent or its fingerprint changed, the whole supersede is stale: it removes nothing, safely appends the new fingerprint, and reports the mismatch. Never append a near-duplicate sibling by choice — a sibling is a bug that fails review; the writer's stale append is the deliberate race-safe preservation path.
   - **No related entry** → append via `persistLearningEntry(projectRoot, entry)` and state in the PR body why appending was correct.
   - Entry mapping (eight fields): `fingerprint` = `learningFingerprint(rule)` and initial `id = fingerprint`; `rule`/`why`/`provenance` from the candidate; `first_learned` = `last_confirmed` = today (ISO date; on consolidation keep the superseded entry's earliest `first_learned`); `confidence` = the judge's `high`/`low`. On an exact stamped consolidation the writer carries forward the deterministic primary target id while persisting the new fingerprint as the version token. Use exact parsed legacy stamps in `supersede`; never rewrite old ids or fingerprints just to adopt the helper. A duplicate fingerprint fails before mutation. The writer re-asserts the entry and token budgets — an over-budget failure means consolidate harder or drop, never truncate by hand.
   - **On a budget-forced drop, signal saturation once (never silent).** When the writer's budget re-assertion cannot fit the entry even after consolidating harder — a durable capture has to be DROPPED for budget — the ledger is saturated, and that pressure must be visible to an operator instead of swallowed. Emit **exactly one** tracker signal via `lisa-tracker-write` (`issue_type: Task`; GitHub trackers carry the `type:Task` label), then continue — dropping the capture never blocks the build. Follow the same marker-dedupe discipline as every other comment here (match on the **marker, never the title**; **exactly one marker per body**; the eventual-consistency guard when the search index is stale), with **one deliberate difference: dedupe against OPEN signals only.** A *closed* saturation ticket means room was already reclaimed, so a fresh saturation is a new actionable event — searching closed tickets too (as the drop/upstream markers do) would permanently suppress every later saturation.

     The saturation fingerprint keys on the **ledger, not the candidate**, so the signal fires once per saturation episode — never once per capture:

     ```text
     saturation-fingerprint = "sat-" + first 12 hex chars of sha1(<resolved learnings-file path>)
     ```

     ```markdown
     <!-- [lisa-ledger-saturated] key=<saturation-fingerprint> -->
     Learnings ledger saturated — a durable capture was dropped for budget. The projection is now omitting entries; promote or retire a learning to reclaim room. This is an operator-visible budget-pressure signal, not itself a new learning.
     ```

     The `[lisa-ledger-saturated]` marker sits **outside the `[lisa-learning-*]` namespace** that the gardener (`lisa-learnings-audit`) auto-excludes from candidacy. The gardener already derives budget pressure independently — it measures the entries its `projectLearnings` projection has to omit — so this ticket does not feed that measurement mechanically; its job is an idempotent, operator-visible notification that saturation happened. Keeping it outside `[lisa-learning-*]` matters so the audit tooling does not silently filter it as learning-machinery noise before an operator sees it. **Do not reuse a `[lisa-learning-*]` marker here.** The signal records the saturation; it does not persist the rule.
   - **The dropped capture is preserved for you — ship it.** The writer does this itself, so there is nothing to compose by hand: when the budget re-assertion fails, `persistConsolidatedLearning` / `persistLearningEntry` write the rejected entry to the **overflow buffer** — `PROJECT_LEARNINGS.overflow.md`, a sibling of the resolved ledger — and then re-raise a budget error naming that file. The thrown error is the confirmation; if it does not name the overflow, the capture was NOT preserved (the overflow is full too) and that is what the error says instead.

     The overflow is git-tracked and bound to the same union merge driver as the ledger, so **still open the pull request on a budget-forced drop** — carrying the overflow file instead of the ledger. That is the whole point of preserving it: a capture that reaches only a disposable `learning/<fingerprint>` worktree is durable in name only, and the gardener draining `main` would never see it. Never hand-edit the overflow, and never delete an entry from it to make room; the gardener drains it.

     So a budget-forced drop produces **both** halves and neither substitutes for the other: the `[lisa-ledger-saturated]` ticket (the signal that room must be reclaimed) and a pull request carrying the overflow file (the content itself). Report both in the run summary.
4. **Branch + commit.** Work on branch `learning/<fingerprint>`. Commit only the learnings surface — the ledger, or the overflow buffer on a budget-forced drop; verify with `git diff --name-only` that the diff touches nothing else.
5. **PR body.** Exactly one marker line plus the reviewable story:

   ```markdown
   <!-- [lisa-learning-pr] key=<fingerprint> -->

   ## Learning
   <rule> — <judge rationale>

   ## Provenance
   - Triggering issue: <ref>
   - Ancestor issue/PR (the past failure this is round 2 of): <ref or none found>
   - Rejection comments that produced the candidate: <refs or none>
   - Cited evidence (from the judge): <refs>

   ## Consolidation decision
   <"Superseded entry id(s) X, Y: <why they merged>" | "Appended: no related entry exists — <one-line search summary>">
   ```

   For a **low-confidence** PR, the body must additionally end with this fixed decision-framing line so the human at the gate knows exactly what merging means:

   ```markdown
   **Merge** to adopt this rule into every future session for all six coding agents; **close** to discard it.
   ```

6. **Confidence routing.**
   - **`high`** → submit through `lisa-git-submit-pr` with its defaults: auto-merge ON, merging through the project's normal gates.
   - **`low`** → submit through `lisa-git-submit-pr` with `auto_merge=false` (drives the PR to green-and-open `awaiting-human`, never merging — even on repos that disallow auto-merge). Then apply the human-triage label, creating it idempotently first (the `lisa-drive-pr-to-merge` label pattern — `|| true` tolerates only already-exists, so verify):

     ```bash
     gh label create "learning:needs-triage" \
       --description "Low-confidence learning PR awaiting human triage" \
       --color FBCA04 || true
     gh label list --search "learning:needs-triage" --json name \
       --jq '[.[].name] | contains(["learning:needs-triage"])'   # must print true
     gh pr edit <pr> --add-label "learning:needs-triage"
     ```

     A low-confidence PR sitting OPEN with green checks and `autoMergeRequest: null` is this mode's **success** state — a human merges or closes it. All pending low-confidence learning PRs are findable by filtering on the `learning:needs-triage` label (`gh pr list --label "learning:needs-triage"`).

## Rules

- **Headless-safe**: no interactive prompts; must run identically under an intake cron.
- **Never block the build**: if judging or persistence fails, report the failure and let the primary flow continue — shipping the triggering issue always outranks recording a learning about it.
- **No learning loops about learning**: never feed this skill a candidate whose triggering artifact is itself learning machinery (a `[lisa-learning-*]`-marked comment, learning PR, or handoff); the judge's Step 0 guard backstops this.
- **Idempotent**: re-running with the same candidate posts no duplicate comment, opens no duplicate PR, and writes no duplicate entry — the fingerprint and markers guarantee it.
- **One write path**: the learnings surface changes only through `persistLearningEntry` / `persistConsolidatedLearning` inside a PR. Never hand-edit the file, never commit it to the default branch directly.
- **Never resolve a ledger conflict by taking one side.** Concurrent passes each work on their own `learning/<fingerprint>` branch, so two PRs routinely touch the same JSONL block. The `lisa-learnings` union merge driver reconciles them by entry id, but when it cannot it exits non-zero **without writing conflict markers** — leaving a clean-looking file that holds **OUR SIDE ONLY**. Driver installation is enabled by default; only an exact `learnings.mergeDriver: false` declines it. That opt-out is non-destructive: changing the setting does not uninstall an existing registration or remove the committed mapping. `git add`-ing the failed result, or running `git checkout --ours`, silently deletes the other branch's learnings. Re-union both sides instead: keep every distinct entry id, honour supersessions from either side, then re-run `lisa check-learnings-budget`. Literal conflict markers in the ledger mean the driver was not registered — run `lisa install-merge-driver .` and redo the merge unless the project explicitly opted out.
