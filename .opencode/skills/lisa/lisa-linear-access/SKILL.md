# Linear Access: $ARGUMENTS

Single chokepoint for Linear operations. Caller skills (`linear-*`) MUST go
through this skill. They MUST NOT call `mcp__linear-server__*` tools directly or
curl `https://api.linear.app/graphql` themselves.

## Invocation Contract

```text
operation: list-teams [query:<KEY>]
operation: get-team id:<ID>
operation: list-projects [team:<KEY>] [label:<NAME>] [state:<arr>]
operation: get-project id:<ID>
operation: save-project payload:{...}
operation: list-issues [team:<ID>] [project:<ID>] [label:<NAME>] [state_type:<arr>]
operation: get-issue id:<ID>
operation: save-issue payload:{...}
operation: list-comments issue_id:<ID>
operation: save-comment issue_id:<ID> body:"..."
operation: list-issue-labels [team:<ID>]
operation: create-issue-label payload:{...}
operation: list-project-labels
operation: create-project-label payload:{...}
operation: list-documents project_id:<ID>
operation: get-document id:<ID>
```

Return parsed JSON in a `<result>` block. On failure, prefix the message with
`Error:` and include the failing operation name.

## Substrate Selection

Read config:

```bash
WORKSPACE=$(jq -r '.linear.workspace // empty' .lisa.config.json 2>/dev/null)
TEAM_KEY=$(jq -r '.linear.teamKey // empty' .lisa.config.json 2>/dev/null)
```

Probe in order:

1. Linear MCP, if `mcp__linear-server__list_teams` is available and can list the
   configured workspace/team.
2. `LINEAR_API_KEY` with Linear GraphQL (`https://api.linear.app/graphql`).

The Linear GraphQL docs support personal API keys for scripts and authenticate
with an `Authorization: <API_KEY>` header. Treat `LINEAR_API_KEY` as the
headless substrate. If neither tier works, fail with:

```text
Error: no Linear access substrate available. Authenticate the Linear MCP or set LINEAR_API_KEY.
```

## GraphQL Adapter

All GraphQL calls use:

```bash
linear_graphql() {
  local query="$1"
  local variables="${2:-{}}"
  [ -n "$LINEAR_API_KEY" ] || {
    echo "Error: LINEAR_API_KEY is not set." >&2
    return 1
  }
  jq -n --arg query "$query" --argjson variables "$variables" \
    '{query:$query, variables:$variables}' |
    curl -sS -X POST "https://api.linear.app/graphql" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -H "Authorization: '"$LINEAR_API_KEY"'" \
      --data-binary @-
}
```

Map operation names to Linear GraphQL queries/mutations in this access skill.
Consumers pass business-shaped arguments only; they do not embed GraphQL.

## Invariants

- MCP is preferred when it is present and already authenticated.
- GraphQL fallback runs only when `LINEAR_API_KEY` is present.
- Missing MCP plus missing token is a hard failure naming `LINEAR_API_KEY`.
- Mutations send only the fields being changed, matching existing Linear skill
  guidance that `save_*` style updates should not clobber unrelated fields.
