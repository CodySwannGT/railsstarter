description: "Wire the official SonarQube plugin + MCP into this project across every supported coding agent. Installs/updates the SonarQube CLI, authenticates (browser login on a dev machine, or SONARQUBE_CLI_TOKEN headless), selects the Test Manager target, runs `sonar integrate <agent>` for each supported agent, and writes only non-secret policy to `.lisa.config.json`. Does not touch the separate CI SonarCloud scan gate."
