description: "Generate the setup/build script and environment-variable template to paste into a Claude Code remote routine environment so this repo runs in the cloud. Runs /lisa:analyze-claude-remote, then writes an idempotent, detect-before-install bash script that installs the required package manager and CLIs for Lisa and the host project, plus a commented env-var template (names only) and a domain allowlist. Cloud-proxy aware and fits the environment-cache time budget."
