description: "Inspect the current project's Lisa automation fleet and report whether the expected recurring jobs exist, match Lisa's setup contract, and show healthy recent activity. Read-only by default."
---
Use the /lisa-automation-status skill to inspect the current project's expected Lisa automations, compare them with the runtime's scheduler metadata, and report fleet health, drift, staleness, unsupported jobs, and remediation hints. $ARGUMENTS

Common operator usage:

- `/lisa:automation-status`
- `/lisa:automation-status --verbose`

This surface is read-only in v1. Use it to understand whether Lisa's unattended jobs are healthy before deciding whether to rerun `/lisa:setup-automations`, inspect scheduler errors, or use `/lisa:intake` / `/lisa:repair-intake` to address queue fallout.
