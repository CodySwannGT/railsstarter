/**
 * Lisa-managed OpenCode plugin (tool.execute.before).
 *
 * Blocks commands that bypass git's verification hooks — `--no-verify` and any
 * prefix abbreviation git accepts for it, the short `git commit -n` (bare or
 * bundled into a cluster such as `-nm "msg"`), `HUSKY=0` / `HUSKY_SKIP_HOOKS=`,
 * and every spelling of `core.hooksPath` that points hooks somewhere that
 * disables them.
 *
 * ## Why a plugin rather than more deny globs
 *
 * OpenCode's `permission.bash` map matches SPELLINGS. Lisa's emit shipped
 * `"*--no-verify*"` and two `git commit -n` prefixes, and that is a filter on
 * how the bypass was typed, not on what git will do with it: `git commit
 * --no-veri` is an unambiguous abbreviation git resolves to `--no-verify` and
 * matched no glob at all. Adding `*--no-veri*` would close that one spelling
 * and leave the class open, because the set of abbreviations git accepts is a
 * property of git's own parser. It also cannot be closed by widening: a glob
 * broad enough to catch `-n` late on a line refuses `grep -n`.
 *
 * The distinction the globs cannot draw is between a token that IS an option
 * and a token that merely CONTAINS the text of one, and drawing it requires
 * tokenizing the command. OpenCode fires `tool.execute.before` for the `bash`
 * tool before the command runs, and a throw from it cancels the call — so the
 * capability was there; the emit was not using it.
 *
 * ## Why it shells out
 *
 * Policy stays single-sourced in `block-no-verify.sh`, the canonical guard
 * Claude, Codex, Cursor and Copilot already run, copied beside this module by
 * the installer exactly as `parity-safety-net.sh` is. A second implementation
 * of git's option grammar in TypeScript would be a second thing to harden, and
 * the two would diverge at the first vector closed in only one of them. This
 * adapter converts OpenCode's `bash` tool input into Lisa's canonical Claude
 * Bash-hook envelope, runs the script, and surfaces its refusal.
 *
 * The `permission.bash` deny globs stay in the emit as a FLOOR, not as the
 * guard: if this plugin fails to load, the literal spellings are still refused.
 * A coarse guard that is present beats a precise one that is absent.
 *
 * NOTE: Lisa copies this template verbatim into `.opencode/plugin/`. It runs
 * under OpenCode's Bun runtime and is excluded from this repository's tsconfig.
