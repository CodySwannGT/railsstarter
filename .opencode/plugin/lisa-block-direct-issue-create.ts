/**
 * Lisa-managed OpenCode plugin (tool.execute.before).
 *
 * Refuses a direct tracker-creation command that declares no readiness. The
 * `ready-role-filing` rule says every filing carries either `build_ready: true`
 * or an explicit `human_gate:` reason and goes through `lisa-track` /
 * `lisa-tracker-write`. An audit of one working session found 13 of 13 issues
 * filed in violation of it, several by the agent that wrote the rule — while
 * the one obligation backed by a git hook was honored 50 out of 50 times. This
 * is that rule promoted from prose to an executable control.
 *
 * Port of Lisa's canonical hook `block-direct-issue-create.sh`. OpenCode
 * exposes the shell as the `bash` tool, so the command arrives on
 * `output.args.command`. Throwing in `tool.execute.before` cancels the tool
 * call and surfaces the message to the agent.
 *
 * BOTH SUBSTRATES. Since CodySwannGT/lisa#3753 the canonical guard covers a
 * second substrate — structured tool payloads, where a creation arrives as
 * named fields rather than a command line. This port covered only `bash` until
 * CodySwannGT/lisa#3785 closed that gap; `refuseUndeclaredStructured` below
 * carries the structured arm and documents the captured OpenCode envelope it
 * was written against. Unlike agy, OpenCode needs no registration change: a
 * plugin's `tool.execute.before` already receives every tool call, so the gap
 * here was the early return alone.
 *
 * The port matches on the raw command text rather than tokenising it, which
 * makes it naturally immune to the prefix and tokenisation bypass classes the
 * shell guard had to be restructured to close — an unrecognised wrapper is just
 * more text before the CLI name.
 *
 * It reaches past the command text in the two places the canonical guard does:
 * into the contents of any file the command names — which is what closes
 * `bash create.sh`, `node wrapper.mjs` and `curl --data-binary @payload.json`
 * — and into the lifecycle-role declaration a state-based tracker has to use
 * because no flag on `curl` can carry a workflow state.
 *
 * Two deliberate differences remain, both in the permissive direction so this
 * port can never refuse something the canonical guard would allow:
 *   - remote execution (`ssh host '…'`) is not intercepted, matching the shell
 *     guard's documented limit;
 *   - a declaration found inside a FILE answers for every creation in that
 *     file. Matching raw text cannot attribute a label to one create among
 *     several, and the alternative — accepting only whole-scope markers there
 *     — would refuse an honest single-create script that carries its label.
 *
 * NOTE: This file is a template Lisa copies verbatim into a host project's
 * `.opencode/plugin/`. It is intentionally excluded from this repo's tsconfig
 * and eslint config — it runs under OpenCode's Bun runtime, not here.

 * ## Why this exists in a guard that otherwise reads raw text
 *
 * CodySwannGT/lisa#3781 found `bash -n <file>` to be the one shape that puts a
 * path in a command position while provably executing nothing, and the
 * canonical guard got it wrong in both directions: a creation-shaped file
 * earned a false refusal, and a file carrying a human-gate marker earned a
 * false ALLOW — adjudicating as "declared" a command that filed nothing. The
 * silent direction is the worse one. CodySwannGT/lisa#3885 found the arm had
 * reached the canonical guard and not this port.
 *
 * The distinction is noexec, not the program: `bash <file>` still runs the file
 * and is still refused.
 *
 * ## Why the LAST shell token, not the first
 *
 * `nice -n 5 bash -n script.sh` is in the canonical guard's own table, and it
 * carries two `-n` flags belonging to different programs. Reading the first
 * token would see `nice`, conclude "not a shell", and follow the file; reading
 * any `-n` anywhere would let `nice -n 5 bash script.sh` masquerade as a syntax
 * check, which is a real bypass. So the shell is located first and only its own
 * options are read.
 * @param segment One command, already split on shell separators.

   * ## Why this exists on a port whose other arm reads a command line
   *
   * CodySwannGT/lisa#3753 taught the canonical guard that a creation also
   * arrives as NAMED FIELDS. This port returned early for every tool but
   * `bash`, so on OpenCode that substrate was unenforced — the shape
   * CodySwannGT/lisa#3785 exists to close.
   *
   * OpenCode's envelope was CAPTURED, not guessed. Driving `opencode run`
   * against a local MCP server exposing one `create_issue` tool, with a probe
   * plugin on `tool.execute.before`, on OpenCode 1.17.13:
   *
   *   input  {"tool":"probe-tracker_create_issue", …}
   *   output {"args":{"title":"envelope probe","body":"capture"}}
   *
   * So unlike agy — which funnels every MCP call through one generic tool name
   * and hides the real one in the arguments — OpenCode names the tool
   * `<server>_<tool>` and puts the tool's own arguments directly on `args`.
   * That is the shape the canonical guard's structured classifier already
   * reads, which is why this arm can transcribe its predicate instead of
   * translating an envelope.
   *
   * ## Why the predicate is transcribed rather than delegated
   *
   * The canonical guard is a bash script, and it is not shipped to OpenCode —
   * this template is the whole of what a host project receives. So the port
   * carries the predicate, as it already does for the shell arm, and the
   * cross-implementation parity suite is what stops the two drifting: it
   * drives both with the same payloads and compares verdicts.
   * @param args The tool's arguments, as OpenCode decoded them.
   * @param policy The filing policy.
   * @param tool The tool name.
   * @throws When the call reads as an undeclared tracker creation.
