# This file is managed by Lisa and IS replaced on each `lisa` run.
# Do not edit directly — durable changes belong upstream in Lisa.

# PreToolUse hook for Bash: a safety net that blocks destructive shell commands
# before they run. Lisa-native reimplementation of the upstream
# `safety-net@cc-marketplace` plugin's PreToolUse Bash-guard (parity work,
# issues #1059 and #1960). It does NOT port upstream code — it re-expresses the
# behavior in Lisa's hook conventions, modeled on block-no-verify.sh.
#
# It reads the hook stdin JSON, inspects the proposed Bash command, and EXITS
# NON-ZERO (2) to BLOCK when a known-destructive pattern matches:
#   - `rm -rf` of a root / home / wildcard path (quote-aware boundaries, so
#     `bash -c "rm -rf /"` and interpreter one-liners are caught too; the rm
#     guards also match path-prefixed invocations like `/bin/rm` and `./rm`)
#   - `rm -rf` of the cwd (`.`), a `..`-traversal path, a `~/`-anchored path,
#     an absolute path outside the project (with a /tmp, /var/tmp, $TMPDIR
#     allowance, each also matched by its symlink-resolved spelling so /tmp and
#     /private/tmp are ONE location), a `$VAR` target that neither is $TMPDIR
#     nor resolves through an unambiguous in-command assignment, or ANY
#     recursive forced delete while cwd is $HOME
#   - force-pushing a protected branch (main/master/production/prod/release) —
#     feature-branch force-push stays allowed (sanctioned rebase workflow;
#     deliberate divergence from upstream's any-branch block). Every git guard
#     sees through leading git GLOBAL options (`-C <path>`, `-c <k>=<v>`,
#     `--git-dir[=…]`, `--no-pager`, …), so `git -C /path <destructive>` cannot
#     dodge the subcommand anchor
#   - `git reset --hard` / `--merge` while the working tree is dirty. Deliberate
#     divergence: upstream blocks unconditionally; Lisa allows clean-tree resets.
#     Residual risk (documented, accepted): the dirty check runs in the hook's
#     cwd at hook time, so a `cd elsewhere && git reset --hard` evades it.
#   - `git read-tree` with an update flag AND `--reset` while the working tree
#     is dirty (issue #3978): the plumbing spelling of the same discard, on the
#     same condition, printing the same remedy. Index-only `read-tree`, and
#     `read-tree -m -u` without `--reset` (which git itself refuses rather than
#     clobber a modified file), stay allowed. Lisa-only guard.
#   - `git rebase --abort`/`--quit` while the in-progress rebase holds
#     human-made conflict resolutions (AUTO_MERGE discriminator; issue #1956).
#     Clean or untouched rebase state stays abortable; the apply backend and a
#     missing AUTO_MERGE ref fail closed. Deliberate divergence: upstream
#     blocks `rebase --abort` unconditionally, which strands agents mid-rebase.
#   - `git checkout` discards (`--`, `-f/--force`, `--pathspec-from-file`,
#     bare `.` — the bare-`.` block exceeds upstream)
#   - `git switch --discard-changes` / `-f/--force`
#   - `git restore` touching the worktree (allowed only with `--staged` and
#     without `--worktree`)
#   - `git stash drop` / `git stash clear`
#   - `git clean` with force and no dry-run (`-n`/`--dry-run` anywhere wins)
#   - `git branch -D` (or `-d` + `-f` in any spelling)
#   - `git tag -d`, `git reflog delete`, `git worktree remove --force`
#   - `find ... -delete`, `find ... -exec rm -rf`, `xargs ... rm -rf`
#   - disk destroyers: `dd of=/dev/...`, `mkfs ... /dev/...`, `shred`
#   - dropping or truncating a database/schema/table (Lisa-only guard)
# Otherwise it exits 0 and the command proceeds. Malformed hook input fails
# CLOSED: any parse error exits 2 (a non-2 exit would be a non-blocking hook
# error in Claude Code, silently failing open).
#
# Narrowed false-positive class (issue #3106): the rm TARGET WALK is now scoped
# to the quoting region that contains the rm, so a recursive delete quoted as
# PROSE no longer turns every later token on the line into a deletion target. A
# variable in an unrelated argument — a `gh issue create --body-file "$G/x"`, a
# `git commit -F "$MSG"` — is no longer read as the thing being deleted. An rm
# outside quotes, or first inside its quoted run (`bash -c "rm -rf /"`,
# `echo "$(rm -rf /)"`), still hands the whole statement to the walk. See
# rm_scan_scope below for the rule and its accepted residual.
#
# Known accepted false-positive class: this is a text scan, not a shell engine,
# so display commands quoting a destructive string (`echo "docs about rm -rf /"`)
# can match — including one whose target sits in the SAME quoted run as the
# prose, which the #3106 scoping deliberately does not reach. Upstream exempts
# those through an engine-only DISPLAY_COMMANDS list that a grep hook cannot
# replicate. WHAT TO DO WHEN YOU HIT IT (issue #3191): do not reword the prose.
# When the destructive text is a commit message, an issue body or a results
# table, the string IS the deliverable and there is no narrower spelling that
# still says what it must say. Write the text to a file with the Write tool and
# pass it BY PATH — `gh issue comment --body-file <file>`, `git commit -F
# <file>` — because these guards scan the COMMAND and never the file. block()
# prints this at the wall so the operator is told rather than left to find it.
# The same text-scan limit means the rm guard treats
# a substitution-wrapped catastrophic delete as verdict-neutral (issue #1982): an
# executable `echo "$(rm -rf /)"` is blocked, but so are inert twins the shell
# would never expand — a single-quoted `echo '$(rm -rf /)'` or an escaped
# `echo "\$(rm -rf /)"` — because the scan has no quote-context awareness. That
# over-block stays inside this accepted class. Workaround: the write-to-a-file
# and pass-by-path form above, or quote-break the string,
# or use the gh-writer heredoc form, whose payload is stripped before the guards
# run — spelled with a QUOTE-PAIR delimiter (`<<'EOF'`). That exact spelling is
# what the SAFE path recognises; `<<"EOF"` and `<<\EOF` do not reach it, and
# since #1993 a `gh … <<\EOF` writer fails closed instead (see parse_marker).
#
# Known accepted BYPASS class (the symmetric error direction, issue #1993): the
# heredoc classifier in parity-safety-net-heredoc.py re-implements bash's
# here-doc lexing in Python, and any divergence from real bash is a shape it
# mis-classifies. Five rounds on #1958 and three more on #1993 (R5a swallowed
# terminator, R5b body-apostrophe quote-state poisoning, R5c backslash-quoted
# delimiter) established that enumerating those divergences is an open-ended
# arms race, so the class is CLOSED as accepted rather than chased further. This
# is survivable because of where a mis-classification lands: ONLY the narrow
# gh-writer SAFE path strips payload text, and every other classifier exit hands
# the RAW command to the guards below. A missed here-doc therefore degrades to
# the content guards; it does not bypass them. Since #1982 taught those guards to
# see through substitution wrappers, every destructive class this net exists to
# stop is blocked on the raw text regardless of how the here-doc was read. The
# net catches ACCIDENTAL catastrophic commands; it is not a wall against an
# adversary who knows bash's lexer, and it was never the only thing standing
# between an agent and arbitrary execution.
#
# Operators extend the built-in rules with a project-local rule file — one

# Guidance printed under an ordinary destructive-guard refusal.

# It teaches the remedy at the wall, the way block_heredoc() does (gardener
# #1789, extended by issue #3191). It used to end in "narrow the command so it

# follow: when the destructive text is a commit message, an issue body or a
# results table, the string IS the deliverable and there is no narrower spelling
# that still says what it must say. An operator acts on a printed remedy, so a
# remedy that cannot be performed is worse than none — it spends the detour and
# teaches that the refusal was a formality. The remedy that does work is the
# sibling heredoc one, one surface over: write the text with the Write tool,
# then pass it BY PATH. The guards scan the COMMAND and never the file, so the
# path form carries the text through intact.
#
# Both branches are printed on every ordinary refusal, deliberately: this guard
# is a text scan and CANNOT tell which one applies, so naming both and letting
# the reader pick is the only honest shape. Deciding for them is what the
# engine-only DISPLAY_COMMANDS list does, and the header explains why a grep
# hook cannot have one.

  cat <<'EOF'
This command matched a destructive-operation guard. The guard is a text scan,
not a shell engine, so it cannot tell a destructive command you are RUNNING
from the same text quoted as CONTENT you are writing. Take the branch that
describes yours:

- The destructive text is only QUOTED CONTENT — a commit message, an issue or
  PR body, a report, a results table, a note. Do not try to reword it; the
  string is the deliverable and no narrower spelling still says what it must.
  Write the text to a file with the Write tool and pass it BY PATH instead:
  `gh issue comment --body-file <file>`, `gh pr create --body-file <file>`,
  `git commit -F <file>`, or read the file back with the Read tool. This guard
  scans the command, never the file, so the path form goes through intact.

- You genuinely intend to run the destructive operation. Ask the user to
  confirm, then run it manually outside the agent.

# How to preserve uncommitted work before an operation that would discard it.
#
# This is appended to the reasons that refuse a discarding operation, and its
# whole point is what it does NOT say (issue #3722). The obvious advice is
# "stash it first", and on a single-checkout repository that is fine. Here it
# is the most dangerous thing an agent can be told: the stash is ONE STACK PER
# CLONE, shared by every worktree, so with concurrent agents a sibling's push
# can shift your entry and a sibling's pop can consume it. `lint-staged` pushes
# one on every commit too, so agent and tooling entries interleave.
#
# A remedy fires at the exact moment an agent is holding the work most worth
# protecting, and a guard's own output reads as authoritative — so pointing it
# at shared mutable state there is worse than the refusal it accompanies.
#
# The patch file is per-worktree: `mktemp` names it, so nothing has to invent a
# filename, and it lives in this agent's own TMPDIR where no sibling can reach
# it. Untracked files are unaffected by both refused operations, so `git diff`
# captures everything at risk. `HEAD` includes staged and unstaged changes, and
# `--binary` keeps binary edits recoverable rather than emitting a text-only
# placeholder that cannot be applied.
#
# Three corrections from issue #3696, each found by EXECUTING the text below
# rather than reading it:
#
# 1. It preserved but never RECOVERED. The text taught how to save the work and
#    how to restore it later, and stopped there — so an agent that followed it
#    exactly and successfully was returned to the identical refusal, because the
#    tree was still dirty. A remedy that does not clear the wall it is printed
#    at is a detour, and #3722 shipped only half the path. The discard branch
#    below is the other half, and every command in it is one THIS GUARD ALREADY
#    PERMITS: mixed `git reset`, `git diff`, and `git apply` are matched by no
#    guard in this file. Nothing was loosened to make room for it — a blind
#    `git reset --hard` on a dirty tree is still refused, unconditionally.
#
#    That the operator must first WRITE DOWN what they are discarding is the
#    feature, not a cost. It is a better acknowledgement than a marker the guard
#    could look for, because a marker agents can type is a marker agents learn
#    to type reflexively; this one cannot be satisfied without producing the
#    artifact that makes the discard reversible.
#
# 2. It did not run as printed. `[-- <path>]` is conventional notation for an
#    optional argument, but bash expands `[...]` as a glob, so pasting the line
#    verbatim failed with `bash: path: No such file or directory` and wrote no
#    patch at all. Guard remedies are unreviewed prose that agents execute
#    literally, so the optional part is now prose and every line is runnable.
#
# 3. `mktemp` was silently a no-op. BSD/macOS mktemp substitutes only TRAILING
#    `X`s, so the `.patch` suffix meant the template came back as the literal
#    string `lisa-preserve-XXXXXX.patch` — one FIXED filename, where successive
#    preserves overwrite each other, in the exact place the comment above claims
#    uniqueness. The suffix is gone rather than spelled portably: GNU mktemp
#    offers `--suffix` and BSD does not, and a patch file does not need an
#    extension. The regression test asserts the produced name DIFFERS from the
#    template, because asserting that the word `mktemp` appears is what let this
#    ship.
#
# NO APOSTROPHES IN THE BODY BELOW. It is a quoted heredoc nested inside a `$( )`
# command substitution, and bash tracks quote state through the body when it
# scans for the closing paren — so a single `'` (in "the agent's TMPDIR", say)
# poisons the parse from there to the next quote and the whole file stops being
# valid shell, with the reported error landing hundreds of lines away in
# untouched code. Every guidance body in this file avoids them for this reason.
# Write "of this session" rather than a possessive.
PRESERVE_GUIDANCE="$(
  cat <<'EOF'
Preserve the work first, per-worktree. `mktemp` names the file, so nothing has
to invent one, and it lands in the TMPDIR of this session, where no sibling
agent can reach it:

  patch="$(mktemp "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/lisa-preserve-XXXXXX")"
  git diff --binary HEAD > "$patch"

Add `-- <path>` before the `>` to scope the capture to one path. Restore it
later with `git apply "$patch"`.

If the work is NOT yours -- a concurrent agent dirtied this worktree and your
judgement is "none of this is mine" -- that same capture is how you return the
tree to HEAD. This block is self-contained; paste it as it stands:

  patch="$(mktemp "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/lisa-preserve-XXXXXX")"
  git reset
  git diff --binary HEAD > "$patch"
  git apply -R "$patch"

It names the file itself rather than inheriting one from the block above,
because the two blocks are alternatives and only one of them gets run. A remedy
printed at the moment an agent is blocked is followed literally; one that
depends on a variable the reader never set fails on its first line, and the
guard that printed it stops being believed.

`git reset` clears staged and unmerged entries first, so the capture sees the
whole tree as one diff; reversing it leaves the tree at HEAD with "$patch" as
the record of what you discarded. Untracked files survive, exactly as they
survive `git reset --hard`.

Do NOT reach for `git stash`. One stash stack is shared by every worktree of a
clone, so a concurrently running agent can consume the entry you just pushed.

# grep answers three ways, not two: 0 it matched, 1 it did not match, and >=2 "I

# a bare `| grep -q` in a condition, where >=2 is indistinguishable from 1. So
# "the scan could not run" was read as "this command is safe", and the safety

# Measured rather than feared (CodySwannGT/lisa#3054). With a `grep` that exits

Blocked by safety-net: a guard's pattern scan FAILED TO RUN (grep exited $1); denying fail-closed.

This is an ENVIRONMENT failure, not a property of your command. The guard could
not be evaluated at all, so the safety net denied rather than guessed — a scan
that cannot answer must never read as "safe".

The usual cause is a machine at its per-user process limit, where fork() starts
returning EAGAIN. Compare:

    ps -u \$(id -u) | wc -l
    sysctl -n kern.maxprocperuid     # Linux: ulimit -u

Re-running is reasonable. If it repeats, the machine cannot fork and no number
of re-runs will change that.

# ─── Follow execution into the file a command RUNS (issue #3612) ─────────────
#
# Every guard below classifies SHELL COMMAND TEXT, and until this block existed
# the only text they ever saw was the command string. A destructive line
# written into a file and then executed reached them as an interpreter name and
# a path, and was ALLOWED — silently, with no output at all — while the same
# line typed inline was refused. Nine spellings were measured against 4.31.1 and
# all nine allowed: `bash <file>`, `sh <file>`, `zsh <file>`, `env bash <file>`,
# `source <file>`, `. <file>`, a shebang script invoked directly,
# `bash -c 'bash <file>'`, and `eval "$(cat <file>)"`. Two more found while
# fixing it — `bash < <file>` and `cat <file> | bash` — allowed as well.
#
# Three more found by review before this shipped, all one shape: a WRAPPER'S OWN
# OPERAND closing the command position before the program is reached, so
# `nice -n 5 bash <file>`, `sudo -u nobody bash <file>` and `timeout 5 bash
# <file>` walked past the invocation. See the wrapper-prefix arms below.
#
# A guard that fails CLOSED spends time; this one failed OPEN on destructive
# actions and reported nothing, so an operator who installed it to gate `rm -rf`
# outside the project got no signal that the check had not run.
#
# WHY IT IS THE DEFAULT PATH rather than an edge case: block_heredoc() above
# refuses heredocs with an instruction to write the payload to a file and
# execute that file. The tooling therefore routed agents onto exactly the shape
# the destructive scan could not see. Nobody had to evade anything. That remedy
# is reworded above, and this block is the half that makes the reworded remedy
# true.
#
# THE RULE: the blind spot is precisely FILE CONTENTS. Every other part of a
# command — including the inner command of a substitution — is text these guards
# already read. So resolve the file an invocation actually RUNS, read it under a
# size cap, and hand it to the guards as further command text.
#
# WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO — the known-wrong fix, already made once in
# this family. #3484 was fixed by teaching a sibling guard to read the contents
# of any file a command NAMES, and that produced #3604: the guard now opens any
# readable file named by any argument and attributes its contents to the
# command, including a path quoted as prose inside a fenced code block in a
# `--body-file` markdown. A path is followed here ONLY when the command EXECUTES
# it. `grep -n x <file>`, `gh pr create --body-file <file>` and
# `git commit -F <file>` name a file as DATA — and $DESTRUCTIVE_GUIDANCE above
# tells operators to use exactly those forms when the destructive text is a
# deliverable, so reading them would break the one remedy that works.
#

#   - Non-shell interpreters (`python3 <file>`, `node <file>`). These patterns
#     are shell syntax; running them over a Python or JS file buys
#     mis-attribution, not coverage. The heredoc remedy no longer names one.
#   - A payload piped from a program's OUTPUT (`curl … | bash`). There is no
#     file to read, and the producing command's own text is already scanned.
#   - An indirection nested inside an ALREADY-FOLLOWED file whose target is
#     computed — `source "$(dirname "$0")/lib.sh"` is the universal shell idiom,
#     and failing closed on it would refuse most real scripts. Top-level
#     indirection is authored by the agent in the command it just wrote, which
#     is where a refusal is both actionable and rare.
# Each is a fail-open the header's ACCEPTED-BYPASS reasoning already covers: the
# net catches ACCIDENTAL catastrophic commands.

see is the thing it exists to stop.

- Name the script by a LITERAL path that exists and is readable — \`bash
  ./scripts/x.sh\` rather than \`bash \"\$SCRIPT\"\` — and the guard can classify it.
- A leading \`cd\` the guard cannot read literally — \`cd \"\$DIR\" && bash x.sh\` —
  leaves it unable to say WHICH copy of \`x.sh\` would run, and a same-named file
  in another directory is a different file. Spell the directory out, or give the
  script its full path.
- A file past the inspection cap is refused rather than half-scanned, because a
  truncated scan reports a confident ALLOW about text it never read. Split it,
  or run it manually outside the agent.
- You genuinely intend to run it as it stands. Ask the user to confirm, then run

# Decide which text of an rm statement the TARGET WALK may read — issue #3106
# arm A. The statement selector matches the RAW command text, so a recursive
# delete quoted as PROSE inside a string argument selects the line, and every
# remaining token on it is then classified as a deletion target. Three
# independent sightings in one day, all of them commands that delete nothing:
# a `printf` reduction, a `gh issue create --title …` filing the report about
# this guard, and a commit message describing it. Each was refused for a
# variable in a LATER, unrelated argument.
#
# The rule is structural, with no allowlist of "display commands":
#   - an rm invocation OUTSIDE any quote is real; the walk reads the whole
#     statement, exactly as before (`rm -rf "$HOME"` keeps its target),
#   - an rm at the START of its quoted run is an invocation the quote merely
#     wraps (`bash -c "rm -rf /"`, `echo "$(rm -rf /)"`); the walk reads the
#     whole statement, exactly as before,
#   - an rm preceded by other words INSIDE its quoted run is prose; the walk is
#     scoped to that run, so the rm's own quoted arguments are still classified
#     in full while a variable in a later argument is no longer read as a
#     deletion target.
#
# Failure directions all point at blocking: an unterminated quote, an
# over-long statement, or any run the scan cannot place falls back to the whole
# statement. Residual (accepted, documented): `eval "prose rm -rf" "$X"` would
# concatenate its words at run time and is scoped to the first run here.

# 3a. `git read-tree` with BOTH an update flag and `--reset`, on the same dirty
#     tree — the plumbing spelling of guard 3 (issue #3978). It resets the index
#     and writes the result into the working tree, discarding tracked
#     modifications: the identical destruction, reached through a command that
#     carries no `--hard` and no `reset` subcommand, so every pattern in
#     guard 3 misses it. A guard an agent can walk around is a guard that stops
#     the honest caller and not the one looking for a way through, and this
#     spelling is strictly worse than the blocked one — it discards WITHOUT
#     preserving, which is exactly the property guard 3's remedy supplies. Both
#     refusals therefore print the same $PRESERVE_GUIDANCE, so what they teach
#     cannot drift apart.
#
#     `--reset` is the discriminator, not `-u`, and the pairing is deliberate:
#
#     - `read-tree` with no update flag touches the INDEX only and destroys
#       nothing in the working tree, so a blanket `read-tree` block would be
#       over-broad.
#     - `read-tree -m -u` (a merge without `--reset`) is safe by git's own
#       construction: it REFUSES rather than overwrite a locally modified file
#       ("entry would be overwritten by merge"). `--reset` is precisely the flag
#       that switches that refusal off.
#
#     So the destructive combination is an update flag AND `--reset` together,
#     in either order. The update flag is matched in the checkout guard's idiom
#     so a bundled short option (`-iu`) cannot dodge the anchor, with leading
#     whitespace required so a `--index-output=/tmp/out-u` style value cannot
#     read as the flag. Same conditional dirty-tree shape and same accepted
#     residual risk as guard 3: the probe runs in the hook's cwd at hook time.

# 14. The git control plane. A recursive forced delete of `.git` destroys every
# commit, branch and stash that is not already pushed — the one directory whose
# loss is not recoverable from the working tree.
#
# This is not a new principle, it is a hole in one the guard already holds. Rule
# 4 above already refuses `rm -rf "$SOMEDIR"` and paths outside the project;
# `rm -rf .git` was permitted only because nothing named it. Measured before
# this rule existed: `rm -rf .git`, `rm -rf ./.git` and `rm -rf .git/objects`
# were all ALLOWED while the variable-expanded case was correctly blocked.
#
# `.git` must be a whole path component. `.gitignore`, `.gitattributes`,
# `.github/` and a `.git-old` backup are ordinary files a project deletes on
# purpose, and blocking those would be the collision that gets a guard switched
# off. The trailing `([/[:space:]'"$qc"']|$)` is what draws that line.
readonly GIT_CONTROL_PLANE='(^|[[:space:]='"$qc"'./])\.git([/[:space:]'"$qc"']|$)'
# This guard is the one segment walk that pairs TWO facts found in different
# places: the protected target (`.git`) and the destructive verb (a recursive
# forced delete). That makes its segmentation load-bearing in a way the rm and
# push walks' is not — those two read a verb and its own operands, which are
# always in one pipeline stage, so splitting on `|` costs them nothing.
#
# Here it cost everything. The old feeder was `tr '&|;' '\n'`, which cut a
# PIPELINE into pieces before the pairing question was asked, and a pipeline is
# exactly how a delete reaches a target named upstream of it:
# `find .git -type f -print0 | xargs -0 rm -rf` became `find .git -type f
# -print0` (a target, no verb) and `xargs -0 rm -rf` (a verb, no target), and
# neither half could answer. Measured before this fix, with the blanket
# `xargs rm -rf` rule masking the reported shape: `find .git -type d | parallel
# rm -rf`, `… | /usr/bin/xargs rm -rf`, `… | xargs -0 -- rm --recursive
# --force`, `… 2>&1 | parallel rm -rf`, `… |& parallel rm -rf` and
# `cat .git/config | grep url | rm -rf refs` were ALL allowed (CodySwannGT/lisa#3320).
#
# So segment on STATEMENT boundaries and nothing else. A pipe joins stages of
# one statement; `;`, `&`, `&&` and `||` end one. Three spellings have to be
# normalized first or a naive split gets them wrong in both directions:
#
#   `|&`    bash's pipe-with-stderr. Splitting its `&` would halve a pipeline —
#           the same fail-open, wearing a different operator. Becomes `|`.
#   `2>&1`  a redirection, not a boundary (also `>&2`, `<&3`, `&>file`). These
#           are where `&` appears WITHOUT ending a statement, and they are
#           common enough that ignoring them would reopen the hole on any
#           pipeline that redirects stderr. The `&` is folded away.
#   `||`    a real boundary that happens to be built from pipe characters, so it
#           must be recognized BEFORE a single `|` is spared. Becomes `;`.
#
# Every one of those rewrites only ever REMOVES a boundary or leaves it intact,
# so each can merge two segments but never split one — the fail-closed
# direction. `&` and `;` still separate, so unrelated commands are not joined.
#
# The leading awk is the same idea one level up. A line ending in `|` is bash's
# OTHER implicit continuation — the pipeline resumes on the next line — and the
# per-line read below would otherwise part the stages exactly as `tr` did, so
# `find .git -type d |`↵`  parallel rm -rf` fails open through the newline
# instead of through the pipe. This mirrors the backslash-continuation join that
# `normalized_command_str` already performs for the same reason. It is done here
# rather than in that shared normalization deliberately: this guard is the one
# that pairs facts across stages, so it is the one that needs the stages kept
# together, and widening the shared normalization would change every other
# guard's segmentation for no defect anyone has measured.
#
# The status check is the second half of the fix and closes a quieter hole. This
# feeder had none, while the rm and push walks above both have one: a segmenter
# that could not run produced no lines, the loop body never executed, and the
# guard was skipped with the command ALLOWED. A segmentation that cannot answer
# must refuse, exactly like a scan that cannot answer.
# 14b. Linked worktrees, which are the same principle one level out. `.git` is
# protected because nothing in the working tree can rebuild it; a linked
# worktree is protected because nothing OUTSIDE it can rebuild what it holds.
# The asymmetry is exact and it is invisible from the prompt: `.git/refs` and
# the object store are shared by every worktree of a repository, while
# `.git/index` and the working files are per-worktree. So `git commit` moves
# work somewhere a deletion cannot reach, and `git add` does not — a staged file
# shows green in `git status`, which reads as saved, and dies with the
# directory.
#
# Measured twice in one evening (issue #3863): one worktree lost a 284-line
# staged test file, and a second lost nothing from the identical event purely
# because a gate had forced its work into a commit first. Neither deletion
# announced itself. That is the second reason this is a block rather than a
# warning — a worktree deletion destroys the only evidence its own case could
# leave, so there is no after-the-fact detection to fall back on.
#
# `git worktree remove` (guard 12) already refuses a dirty tree, and
# `--force` is already blocked. This closes the spelling that walks around both:
# `rm -rf` on the directory, which git never sees.
#
# Matching is by REGISTERED path — `git worktree list` names them — so an
# ordinary directory that merely lives near one is untouched. A repository that
# cannot be read answers "no": this guard adds protection to a shape that was
# fully allowed a moment ago, and failing it closed would deny every recursive
# delete on every path outside a repository.
#
# The comparison is on WHOLE TOKENS, which is the only spelling that gets both
# error directions right. Substring containment would let a worktree named
# `wt-1` claim `rm -rf wt-10`, an over-block on an unrelated directory; and
# hand-written boundary classes leak the other way, because `rm -rf <wt>/`
# with one trailing slash ends on a character every such class treats as
# "inside a path". So every non-path character — quote, space, parenthesis,
# redirection — is folded to a space first, which makes each argument a
# space-delimited token regardless of how it was quoted, and the match is then
# an equality test on that token. A SUBPATH (`rm -rf <wt>/node_modules`) is
# deliberately not this guard's business: it is not a worktree deletion, and
# blocking routine cleanup inside a worktree is how a guard gets switched off.
