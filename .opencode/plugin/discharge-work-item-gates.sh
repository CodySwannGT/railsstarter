# Discharge Deferred Work-Item Gates Hook (PostToolUse - Bash)
# =============================================================================
# Two of the five Work-Item Traceability gates live OUTSIDE the commits: gate 4
# is the `Work-Item:` line in the pull-request BODY, and gate 5 is the managed
# `[lisa-pr-link]` backlink on the item. A push cannot check either one —
# both are properties of a pull request, and the push is what makes the pull
# request possible — so until this hook existed the next thing that looked was
# CI, one cycle later (CodySwannGT/lisa#3791).
#
# This fires the moment a pull request is created or its body edited, which is
# the FIRST moment both gates are checkable. It evaluates them, and posts the
# backlink that gate 5 needs, so neither waits for a red CI run to be revealed.
#
# Exit 2 blocks and hands the output back to the agent, which is the point: a
# non-blocking notice here would be the same defect the discharge exists to
# fix — a finding delivered somewhere nobody has to act on it.

# discharge for it is free (CodySwannGT/lisa#3916).
