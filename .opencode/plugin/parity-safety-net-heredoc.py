"""Classify the only heredoc forms whose payload is non-executable text.

SCOPE — read this before hardening anything here (issue #1993).

This module is a HEURISTIC RE-IMPLEMENTATION of bash's here-doc lexing, not an
adversary-resistant control. Every divergence between this Python model and real
bash is, by construction, a potential mis-classification, and five rounds of
fix-then-re-attack on issue #1958 plus three more here (#1993) established that
enumerating those divergences is an open-ended arms race. Treat the class as
CLOSED: a newly found member is documented, not chased, unless someone first
demonstrates it defeats the CONTENT GUARDS, which are the layer that matters.

The one hard guarantee, and the reason a mis-classification is survivable:

    Exit SAFE(0) is the ONLY path that strips payload text, and it requires the
    narrow, fully-quoted `gh issue|pr create/edit/comment` + `<<'EOF'` grammar in
    ``classify_safe``. EVERY other path — UNSUPPORTED(10) and MALFORMED(20) —
    hands the RAW, unmodified command to the content guards. So a here-doc the
    classifier mis-reads degrades to the guards; it does not bypass them. Any
    change here must preserve that property: widen ``classify_safe`` only with
    proof, and keep every other exit raw-pass-through.

Known accepted bypass class (measured, deliberately not chased further):
R5a — a trailing backslash on the last body line is a bash continuation that
swallows the terminator; R5b — an odd apostrophe in an unquoted body poisons a
flat quote scanner past the terminator; R5c — `<<\\DELIM` is a quoted delimiter
this parser did not model. All three are FIXED below, but they are members of a
family, not the family itself. Each requires deliberately-crafted input; none is
a shape an agent emits by accident; and post-#1982 every destructive class the
safety net exists to stop is independently blocked by the content guards on the
raw text.

The two bash invariants this file relies on — both measured directly against
/bin/bash, not inferred — so a future round starts from a spec:

1. UNQUOTED delimiter (`<<EOF`): the body performs NO quote or comment
   processing (`'`, `"`, `#` are literal data bytes) but STILL expands `$(...)`,
   backticks and parameters, and bash removes `\\<newline>` continuations BEFORE
   matching the delimiter. Measured: `cat <<EOF` / `foo\\` / `EOF` / `bar` emits
   `fooEOF\\nbar` — the here-doc never terminated.
2. QUOTED delimiter in any spelling (`<<'EOF'`, `<<"EOF"`, `<<\\EOF`): the body is
   fully literal, no expansion of any kind, and backslash is DATA rather than an
   escape — so the delimiter IS matched per physical line there. Measured: the
   same trailing-backslash shape under `<<'EOF'` emits `foo\\` and then fails on
   `bar: command not found`.

That asymmetry is why the continuation handling in ``terminator_line_index`` is
conditioned on ``Marker.quoted`` rather than applied uniformly.

``Marker.quoted`` means "bash makes this BODY literal" and nothing more. The
three spellings above are interchangeable for body semantics ONLY — they are NOT
interchangeable on the writer path. ``classify_safe`` still demands the literal
``<<'DELIM'`` spelling, so `<<"EOF"` and `<<\\EOF` can never reach SAFE(0); since
#1993 they additionally record a Marker, which arms the writer-owns-a-real-marker
and multi-marker rules and lands a `gh … <<\\EOF` writer on MALFORMED(20) where it
used to be UNSUPPORTED(10). That is a deliberate, test-pinned over-block: the
documented payload-strip workaround is spelled `<<'EOF'`. Widening
``classify_safe`` to admit other spellings is a separate change needing its own
proof — do not do it as a side effect of body-semantics work.

    Bash (C locale) treats NONE of these as a blank or a metacharacter, so a
    ``#`` preceded by one stays INSIDE the current word — it does NOT start a

    EXECUTED. Every comment-boundary walker here must therefore match bash's
    actual blank set, not Python's: using ``str.isspace()`` let the scanner call
    ``#`` a comment where bash does not, skip to the newline, and go blind to a
    live substitution — smuggling arbitrary command execution past the wall
    (issue #1958 Finding R2). This is the single shared home of that predicate so
    every walker stays in lockstep with bash's word-boundary rule; fail-closed on

    splits with ``splitlines()`` then rejoins with ``\\n``, so a ``echo X\\x1c#$(…)``

    escapes the next single character, so ``\\'`` is a literal quote (does NOT
    close the string) and ``\\\\`` is a literal backslash. Only literal
    single quotes act as delimiters — value-only escapes like ``\\x27`` /
    ``\\047`` / ``\\uHHHH`` decode to a quote *character* but never terminate
    the token, so scanning for the first unescaped ``'`` yields exactly bash's
    token boundary for every spelling.

    A naive single-quote scanner that ignores ``$'...'`` desyncs from bash on an
