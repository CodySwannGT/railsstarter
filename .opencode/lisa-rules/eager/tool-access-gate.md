# Tool Access Gate (load-bearing)

- If you can't reach something you need, such as a repository, a secret, an API, or a connector, say exactly what's missing in your first message and stop. Don't substitute, mock, or guess.

If the missing access is discovered after work begins, say exactly what's
missing in your next message and stop.

Only take on work you can finish. Before implementation starts — and again the
moment a new requirement surfaces mid-flow — enumerate every external tool the
work item needs (implementation, proof command, remote verification: AWS CLI,
Figma, Jam, Sentry, SonarCloud, PostHog, device/browser harnesses, databases,
deploy targets, …) and **prove access with a cheap read-only probe**, routing
through the matching `*-access` skill where one exists. Resolve credentials through the documented access path before probing;
presence on PATH is not access. If that path or the probe cannot provide the
required access, report the gap and stop.

The message must name the missing resource, the operation it blocks, and any
known access requirement, without exposing secret values. Substituting weaker
verification, mocking the inaccessible system, guessing at its contents, or
narrowing scope to dodge the gap are all forbidden.
