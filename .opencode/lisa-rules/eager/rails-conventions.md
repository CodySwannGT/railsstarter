# Rails Coding Conventions (load-bearing)

Rails-specific standards for this project. The head below is what changes
behaviour in a session that never asks for it; the worked examples for every
point live in the reference body.

## Mandatory

1. **Fat models, skinny controllers.** Controllers handle HTTP concerns only.
   Business logic belongs in a model or a service object under `app/services/`.
2. **Strong parameters always, `permit!` never.** Enumerate the permitted keys.
3. **No N+1 queries.** Use `includes` / `preload` / `eager_load` on any
   association you iterate. Bullet is installed to catch the ones you miss.
4. **Never edit `db/schema.rb` by hand.** Change it through a migration, honour
   the `strong_migrations` constraints, and index every foreign key and
   commonly-queried column.
5. **Scopes, not class methods,** for chainable queries. Prefer built-in
   validators; keep callbacks to simple normalization and push complex side
   effects into a service object.
6. **RSpec with `factory_bot` and `shoulda-matchers`,** not fixtures. Use
   `described_class` and keep one assertion concept per example.
