# Operational Hazards — Short-Lived, Expiring, and Read by Sessions That Do Not Exist Yet

**A broadcast cannot reach a session that starts after it, and the sessions that missed it never
knew there was something to miss.** The lanes most likely to collide on a port, saturate the
workers, or re-hit a defect somebody diagnosed an hour ago are precisely the ones that just
started — so the population a fan-out structurally cannot reach is the population most exposed.

Enumerating peers does not fix it: two sessions listing peers at the same moment returned different
rosters, so "I told everyone" carries an unknown hole.

## Mandatory

- **Declare a transient hazard instead of announcing it.** A condition another session will hit —
  a port another lane holds, a saturated resource, a command that dumps credentials, a gate that is
  red for an environmental reason — is not communicated until this has run:

  ```
  node "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/hooks/operational-hazards.mjs" --declare <id> \
    --hazard "<what will go wrong>" \
    --avoid "<what to do instead>" \
    --until <YYYY-MM-DD>
  ```

  `--until` is required and has no default. **An entry that never expires is doctrine, and doctrine
  belongs in a rule** — a hazard surface without an expiry becomes permanent scripture, which is
  the failure this exists against. Past its `until`, an entry stops being shown with nobody
  remembering to remove it.

- **Lift it when it ends.** A declaration nothing can void is the defect the QA-failure signal and
  the human gate each closed:

  ```
  node "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/hooks/operational-hazards.mjs" --lift <id> --because "<what resolved it>"
  ```

- **Read it where no hook runs:** `node "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/hooks/operational-hazards.mjs" --list`.

## What arrives on its own

On Claude Code the ledger is read for you at SessionStart **and SubagentStart** — a subagent
spawned an hour from now reads it, which no fan-out reaches at all — and re-checked after every
tool call, so a hazard declared or lifted **while you are running** arrives on your next tool
result. Two `stat` calls when nothing changed.

An entry naming no evaluable expiry still applies and is reported as `unchecked`, loudly. An expiry
that lapsed into "no longer shown" would restore permanent scripture while every signal read
healthy.

Both ledger tiers, what belongs here versus in a rule, and the surfaces with no hook runtime:
