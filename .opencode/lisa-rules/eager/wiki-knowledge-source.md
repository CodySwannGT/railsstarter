# Wiki as Knowledge Source (load-bearing)

If the project has an LLM Wiki, treat it as the canonical source of durable project knowledge. A project has a wiki when **either** a local `wiki/` directory with `index.md` exists **or** `.lisa.config.json` declares a `wiki.source` pointer to a remote wiki repo. Documentation rolls UP into that wiki; individual repos are not expected to carry their own prose docs beyond inline code comments.

You never have to fetch or freshness-check the wiki yourself: the query and ingest skills resolve the wiki root and guarantee it exists and is current (via `scripts/ensure-wiki.mjs`) as their own first step — a local wiki resolves instantly, a remote wiki is mirrored/refreshed transparently into a gitignored working copy. Just call the skill.

Before researching background, conventions, ownership, architecture, glossary, or "how/why does X work here":

1. **Consult the wiki first.** Use the wiki query skill (`/lisa-wiki-query`), which resolves the wiki root for you; for a local wiki you may also start from `wiki/index.md` directly.
2. **Use what the wiki says** as the authoritative answer when it covers the question — do not re-derive it from raw sources.
3. **Fall back to primary sources** (code, tickets, commit history, external docs) only when the wiki is silent, ambiguous, or contradicted by what you observe.
4. **Surface gaps.** If the wiki is wrong, stale, or missing knowledge that belongs there, flag it — and where the workflow supports it, capture the correction via `/lisa-wiki-ingest`.

The wiki documents knowledge; it does NOT override executable behavior. When wiki and running code disagree about what the system does, trust the code and treat the wiki as out of date.

If the project has neither a local `wiki/` nor a `wiki.source` pointer, this rule does not apply.
