# Rule Index — What Exists, and Where to Read It

The rules below are **not loaded**. Each is a full contract that other rules,
skills, and work items cite **by slug** ("per the `bdd-e2e-coverage` rule").
When you meet a slug and need the contract behind it, read that file — do not
re-derive the contract, and do not restate it where you cite it.

Read one when you are doing the thing it governs. Reading none of them is the
normal case for a session, which is why they are here rather than in your
context: the eager tier was cut to 26,540 bytes in May 2026 and had regrown to
201,083 by September, at which point every session and **every subagent** paid
~50,000 tokens before its first tool call (CodySwannGT/lisa#3992).

Paths are relative to this file.
