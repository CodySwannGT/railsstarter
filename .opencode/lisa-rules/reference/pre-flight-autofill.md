# Pre-Flight Spec Autofill (Draft-Then-Block)

When the pre-flight gate (`*-agent` Step 2) returns `FAIL` on **ticket-quality**
gaps, the agent does **not** bounce a raw "here is everything you must write"
checklist back to the reporter. Most "missing required spec content" gaps are
**authorable** from material already on the work item (title, description,
screenshots, design links, reproduction steps) plus the codebase. The agent
drafts a best-effort version of every authorable gap, writes it into the work
item as clearly-labeled **assumptions and recommendations**, and only **then**
blocks — turning the human ask from *"author all of this from scratch"* into
*"confirm or correct my draft, then flip it back to Ready."*

This is the same shape as the `repo-scope-split` exception: the agent does the
work it can and reserves the human for what only a human can decide. It does
**not** widen the gate — every required section must still exist before build;
autofill just supplies a defensible first draft instead of an empty demand.

## Why this exists

The build + screenshot-diff verification pipeline needs **structured,
machine-readable** sections — Gherkin acceptance criteria, a Validation Journey
with `[SCREENSHOT:]`/`[EVIDENCE:]` markers, Sign-in Required, Target Backend
Environment, Repository. A bug report routinely contains all of that
*information* in prose, screenshots, or a Figma link, but not the *structure*.
Dumping the checklist straight back produces a ping-pong loop: the item bounces
`Ready → Blocked → Ready` on every intake cycle because nobody re-types the
existing information into headings, and the reporter reasonably objects that the
information is already there. Drafting the structure breaks the loop and
respects the reporter's time — the human reviews a draft instead of authoring a
spec.

## Two tiers of gap

**Tier A — authorable (always attempt a draft):**

- **Technical Approach** — locate the affected component/files in the repo (the
  title and description usually name the surface, e.g. "Player modal"); state
  which files likely change and the expected layout. Flag inferences as
  assumptions.
- **Out of Scope** — a one-line boundary derived from the fix list.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin)** — convert each described fix / expected
  behavior into `Given/When/Then`. One scenario per discrete fix.
- **Expected-vs-actual + environment** — restate the bug as explicit expected
  vs actual, naming the environment the screenshots/description came from.
- **Repository** — resolve per `config-resolution` repo scoping and state it.
- **Relationship Search** — actually **run** the git + tracker search; record
  the queries and results and link anything found. Do not fabricate a
  "none found" note.
- **Validation Journey (draft)** — run the vendor `*-add-journey` skill to draft
  the click-path, markers, and viewports from the reproduction steps. This is a
  draft for human approval, not the final ratified contract.
- **Target Backend Environment** — for bugs, first parse the reported
  environment from the title, description/body, screenshots captions, links, and
  reproduction steps. Bare words such as `dev`, `staging`, `prod`, and
  `production` count, as do environment-bearing URLs such as
  `staging.<domain>`, `gql.staging.*`, and `dev.<domain>`. That reported
  environment is authoritative for the draft. Only recommend the repo's
  remote default branch when no environment is discoverable anywhere in the
  work item, and record the default as an explicit assumption.

**Tier B — irreducibly human (cannot invent — but still propose a default):**

- **Real credentials / access** that exist nowhere on the item or in the repo's
  known test-user docs. (If credentials are present in prose, that is Tier A —
  lift them into a Sign-in Required section.)
- **A genuine product / scoping decision** with no defensible default — the
  exact expected behavior when the ticket is internally contradictory or the
  design reference is missing.

For Tier B, still propose a **recommended default** wherever one is defensible,
and ask a **specific question** only where none is. Never reduce a Tier B item
to a bare demand.

## Procedure

1. **Enumerate the FAIL categories** from `*-verify`.
2. **Run `repo-scope-split` first** if S10 (single-repo scope) failed — that is
   a split, not an autofill. Autofill handles the remaining quality gaps.
3. **Draft each Tier-A gap** grounded in the work-item material + codebase.
   Every inferred value is explicitly tagged as an assumption/recommendation
   (lead the drafted block with a note: *"Drafted by Claude — assumptions
   flagged inline; please confirm or correct."*). **Never overwrite
   human-authored prose** — add the missing structured sections; if a section
   exists but is thin, augment it without discarding the human's words.
4. **Write the draft into the work item** via the vendor write skill
   (`jira-write-ticket` / `github-write-issue` / `linear-write-issue`) so
   relationship and metadata gates stay enforced. Draft the Validation Journey
   via the vendor `*-add-journey` skill.
5. **Re-run `*-verify`.** The structural gates should now PASS (the content
   exists, even if assumed). Any gate that still FAILs is Tier B — leave it and
   name it precisely in the comment.
6. **Block as usual** — transition/relabel to the configured `blocked` status,
   add the `human_needed` marker, reassign to the **Reporter** — but post the
   **confirmation comment** (below), not a remediation checklist.
7. **Idempotency / loop-safety.** If the item already carries the agent's draft
   from a prior cycle, do **not** redraft from scratch — refine only the gaps
   still failing and refresh the confirmation comment. When the reporter flips
   the item back to Ready, the next claim re-runs `*-verify`; if it now PASSes,
   build proceeds on the draft the reporter approved by re-readying it. That is
   what breaks the `Ready ↔ Blocked` loop.

## The confirmation comment (replaces the remediation checklist)

- **Disclose**: posted by Claude (AI build agent); identify the content as a
  draft.
- **Frame it**: the item had the right information but lacked the structured
  sections the pipeline needs, so the agent drafted them — the report's validity
  was never in question.
- **One line per drafted section**, naming the section and the key assumption
  (e.g. *"Acceptance Criteria — drafted 4 Gherkin scenarios from the fix list;
  assumed 'Search result' restores the prior query terms."*).
- **Tier-B items still required**, each as a specific question with a
  recommended default where one exists.
- **Close with the action**: *"Review the drafted sections in the description.
  Correct anything wrong, then flip back to Ready and it builds immediately — or
  reply with corrections and I'll revise."* Keep the `human_needed` marker until
  then.

## When you genuinely cannot autofill (fall back to the plain block)

If the item is so underspecified that drafting would be fabrication — no fix or
expected behavior described, no usable design reference, an uninformative title,
and the codebase gives no anchor — block as before. Even then, phrase **each gap
as a specific question** and propose a default wherever one is defensible (the
"Human-Needed is a last resort" principle). Never bounce a bare checklist when a
defensible draft is possible.

## Disclosure & safety

- Agent-drafted content is **always attributed to Claude and marked as
  assumptions**, so a human never mistakes a guess for their own ratified spec.
- The agent writes **spec/criteria, never code**, at this gate. Drafting
  acceptance criteria and a validation journey is authoring, not implementation
  — explicitly permitted here. This **supersedes** the older "the build agent
  does not author the missing spec content" stance, which produced the
  bounce-loop.

## Vendor mechanics

- **JIRA** — draft sections via `jira-write-ticket`; Validation Journey via
  `jira-add-journey`; block + label + reassign + comment via the `jira-agent`
  Step 2 exception (`transitionJiraIssue`, `editJiraIssue` for the label and
  assignee, `addCommentToJiraIssue`).
- **GitHub** — `github-write-issue`; `github-add-journey`; relabel + reassign +
  comment via `gh`.
- **Linear** — `linear-write-issue`; `linear-add-journey`; `save_issue` +
  `save_comment`.
