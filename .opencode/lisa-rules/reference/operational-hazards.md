# Operational Hazards — reference

Full contract behind the `operational-hazards` slug (CodySwannGT/lisa#3681). The eager rule carries
the two commands; this is the reasoning, the tiers, and the boundary against doctrine.

## The general property

**A detector whose only failure mode is staying quiet cannot be audited.** A fan-out reaches the
sessions alive at one instant. The sessions that were not alive receive nothing and are told
nothing, so nobody — the sender included — can name who was missed.

Measured on one machine in one hour: one session started 18 minutes after a warning it needed;
another started 8 minutes after a different one; four more appeared and vanished entirely inside
the hour. And the lanes most likely to collide are the ones that just started and are standing up
fresh environments — so the warning that would have prevented the collision cannot reach the
session that causes it, because that session does not exist yet.

**The hole is unmeasurable, not merely growing.** Two sessions on the same machine, enumerating
peers at the same moment, returned different rosters: one session appeared in one listing and had
never appeared in four consecutive reads by the other. So "I enumerated the roster and checked the
list" carries an unknown hole, and a fan-out audited against one session's view cannot be audited
at all.

## What the existing rule injector cannot do

`inject-rules.sh` reads `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/rules/eager` — the plugin root, not the project. A
project cannot register anything there without editing an installed plugin, which the next apply
overwrites. And it concatenates every `.md` unconditionally: no front matter, no date, no filter.
Anything written there is injected on every start, permanently, until a human deletes the file.

So the injector is the right *reach* and the wrong *store*. This ledger reuses the reach — the same
two start events, plus the tool-result event — and supplies a project-owned store whose entries
carry a condition something evaluates.

## Why the expiry is the mechanism, not a convenience

**The expiry is what separates a transient hazard from doctrine**, and it is the only reason the
surface can be trusted with transient content: nobody has to remember to remove anything. A hazard
surface without an expiry becomes the permanent-scripture problem, and a project that has watched
that happen once will correctly refuse to use the surface again.

The shape is deliberately the threshold-ratchet exemption's (CodySwannGT/lisa#3856) rather than a
third scheme:

- record the condition in a form something can evaluate — `until`, a `YYYY-MM-DD` day or an
  ISO-8601 timestamp, live *through* the day named;
- never let an unevaluable condition lapse into the permissive answer. An entry naming no evaluable
  expiry — hand-written, or written before `until` existed — **still applies**, and is reported as
  `unchecked` every time it is read.

An expiry that lapses into "no longer shown" is worse than no expiry: it restores permanent
scripture in reverse — the hazard vanishes — while every signal still reads healthy. That is why
the writer refuses `--declare` without `--until`, and refuses an `until` it cannot parse, while the
reader tolerates one and says so.

## The inverse

A hazard also ends before its expiry. A declaration nothing can void is the defect closed twice
already — the QA-failure signal (CodySwannGT/lisa#3855) and the human gate (CodySwannGT/lisa#3852)
— so `--lift` appends a void record naming what resolved it.

Matching is **time-ordered**: a lift voids only a declaration that pre-dates it. A hazard
re-declared after an earlier lift is therefore not born discharged, which is the unsafe direction
#3852 records as the one this must not introduce. For the same reason the ledger union keeps the
**newest** declaration for an id, not the first one read.

## The ledger's two tiers

- **`.lisa/HAZARDS.jsonl`**, committed — reaches every future reader of this project and merges by
  git's built-in union driver. This is also the tier that answers "does `lisa apply` preserve it":
  it is host-authored content under `.lisa/`, like the withdrawal tombstones beside it, and no
  managed-file reconciliation writes it.
- **`${LISA_STATE_HOME:-~/.lisa}/operational-hazards.jsonl`** — reaches sibling sessions in OTHER
  worktrees on this machine *now*, which a committed file cannot do until it is merged and pulled.
  For the fleet case above, this is the tier that matters.

`--declare` and `--lift` write both. Reads are the union. Both files are append-only JSONL, so
concurrent writers on their own branches reconstruct exactly under `merge=union`.

## How a running session is reached

`--session-start` delivers everything applying and stamps what the session was born knowing.
`--hook` runs as a PostToolUse hook and announces only what changed since that stamp: a hazard
declared while this session runs, and a **lift** of a hazard this session was told about. Both
directions were measured — the provenance of #3681 is a session that was sent a lift for a hold it
had never received.

A missing stamp is deliberately silent. A session whose starting knowledge is unknown would
otherwise be told every historical hazard, which degrades the mechanism into distrusting
everything.

The common path is cheap: when neither tier's `size:mtime` has moved, `--hook` exits after two
`stat` calls without parsing anything. It fires on every tool call in every session, so anything
expensive multiplies.

## Surface parity

The hook pair ships into every payload that carries the base hooks, and the injector fires on
`SubagentStart` as well as `SessionStart` — which makes this better than a broadcast rather than
merely equivalent, since a fan-out never reaches a subagent at all.

Surfaces with no PostToolUse runtime get the start-event half and `--list`. That is the honest
split: **the durable half — reaching every session that starts later — is closed everywhere the
hook installs. The already-running half depends on a tool-result event, so where there is none, a
running session is reached only when it runs `--list`.**

## What deliberately does not belong here

Anything that should still be true next month. A hazard is a condition of *this machine, this
branch, this hour*: a port another lane holds, a resource one run has saturated, a command that
dumps more than you asked for, a gate red for an environmental reason. If the entry would want
renewing when it expires, it was never a hazard — promote it through the learnings ladder to a rule
or an executable control, and let the entry lapse.

Not a severity taxonomy, not a notification system, and not a change to how eager rules work.
