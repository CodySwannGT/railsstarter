## Claim → Evidence Mapping Contract (load-bearing)

**Every claim about the software declares a boundary, and a claim is established only by evidence of
a kind that reaches that boundary.** Unit tests are a quality prerequisite, not a claim discharger:
a passing unit `test-run-log` reaches only the **code-unit** boundary. Citing evidence whose *kind*
does not reach a claim's *boundary* — a unit log offered as proof that a button works in the browser
— is a contract violation, and a review-rejectable defect.

## The claim-boundary taxonomy (closed set)

Every claim binds to exactly one boundary, and each boundary is discharged only by evidence of the
kind(s) that reach it. The boundaries and their establishing evidence kinds are seeded verbatim from
the `verification` rule's artifact-type taxonomy — no new vocabulary is invented here:

- **`code-unit`** — pure-logic behavior in isolation → unit `test-run-log`. Reaches no boundary
  below it.
- **`browser`** — user-visible UI behavior → `screenshot`, `recording`. **Never** a unit
  `test-run-log`.
- **`http-api`** — request/response contract → `http-transcript`. **Never** a unit `test-run-log`.
- **`cli`** — command behavior → `cli-output`.
- **`data`** — persisted state → `db-query-output`, `state-dump`.
- **`deploy-health`** — a healthy running deployment → `deploy-log`. **Never** any pre-deploy
  artifact.
- **`performance`** — latency/throughput/frame timing → `perf-trace` (with methodology).
- **`standards-compat`** — conformance to an external standard → `cli-output` / `test-run-log` from
  the compat runner.

## The core inequality

**unit tests ≠ browser behavior ≠ healthy deployment ≠ standards compatibility.** Each is a distinct
boundary; evidence at one never discharges a claim at another. "Verified" must name the boundary its
evidence actually reaches, so a report read at the gate states its own limits (`factory-model`
rule 5).

## Field names (fixed here, made executable later)

A claim carries three fields — `claim_id`, `boundary`, and `required_evidence_kinds` — named here so
every downstream surface uses one spelling. This ticket only writes the contract down; the schema and
gate that make these fields executable ship with **BCE-2 (#1836)** — do not assume that surface is
present in this branch.

## Security buckets (conservative by default)

A security finding is **proven** only with both a reproducer of a reaching kind and a bounded
impact/exploitability statement; missing either, it renders **unproven** with its reason and **stays
in the security section** — never auto-demoted to maintenance. The label is one policy point,
`security.review.unprovenBucket` (default `security-unproven`); the procedure lives in the
`lisa-security-review` skill.

## Artifact identity (pinned, never assumed)

A claim applies only to the artifact its evidence was collected against. Every verdict pins
`artifact.head_sha` — the commit the run observed — and every evidence entry pins the
`artifact_head_sha` in force when it was captured, its `sha256` content digest, and `captured_at`.
Evidence collected on a pre-merge head is valid for the merge commit **only** when that head is a
parent of the merge, per the ancestry + deploy-run definition of "what shipped" that
`lisa-drive-pr-to-merge` already owns — cite it, never write a second one. A mismatched SHA or a
recomputed digest that disagrees fails loudly, naming both SHAs / the evidence id, and verification
re-runs against the merged head before completion is declared. Full definition: the reference body.

## Not established (required, never omitted)

A claim with no reaching evidence is **Not established**, and every report says so out loud. Each
evidence comment and verdict carries a `Not established` section listing what was *not* proved —
boundaries not exercised, environments not tested, behavior consciously out of scope. It is never
omitted and never blank: with nothing outstanding it still renders `None outstanding — reviewed`, and
`not_established_reviewed` attests the list was reviewed even when the list itself is empty. This
generalizes the required, never-empty `Known limits` field of `lisa-improve-harness`. Full definition
and operator-voice exemplars: the reference body.

## No behavior change; degrade, never block

This rule is documentation, not a gate: it changes no schema, no skill, and no check. Where a later
surface it names is not yet installed, cite the boundary a claim reaches and continue — never block
on the absent surface. Read the contract to someone who has never seen Lisa and they should be able
to say why a unit-test log does not prove a button works in the browser.

---

Lisa's verification machinery already proves outcomes empirically, but nothing states *which kind of
evidence establishes which kind of claim*. So a claim about browser-visible behavior, supported only
by a unit-test log, currently reads as "verified" — the report never names the boundary its evidence
actually reaches. This contract writes the mapping down once, as the single spine every evidence
surface cites: **every claim declares a boundary, and a claim is established only by evidence of a
kind that reaches that boundary.**

It is a **single vendor-neutral contract**. The later tickets of this PRD instantiate it rather than
redefine it: the `verification-status.json` schema and gate that make the claim fields executable
(**BCE-2, #1836**), the *Not-established* section and evidence templates (**BCE-3, #1837**), artifact
identity (**BCE-4, #1838**), and security buckets (**BCE-5, #1839**) each cite this slug. This ticket
adds no schema, no gate, and no skill edit — exactly as the `automation-runbook-contract` rule
preceded the skills that made it executable.

## Consumers

Every surface that asserts a claim is proved cites this contract for what "proved" means at that
claim's boundary: the verification flow and its `verification-specialist`, the evidence-posting and
completion gates, the QA and Verify factories' reports, and any report a human reads at a gate. None
of them redefines the mapping; each binds its claim to a boundary and cites evidence of a reaching
kind.

## The claim-boundary taxonomy

Every claim binds to exactly one **boundary**. The table binds each boundary to the evidence kind(s)
that establish it and at least one kind that cannot. The **establishing evidence kind(s)** column is
drawn verbatim from the `verification` rule's artifact-type taxonomy (its fixed set:
`screenshot`, `recording`, `http-transcript`, `cli-output`, `log-snippet`, `db-query-output`,
`perf-trace`, `test-run-log`, `deploy-log`, `state-dump`) — this contract invents no new evidence
types; it only says which reach which boundary.

| Claim boundary | What it asserts | Establishing evidence kind(s) | Cannot be established by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `code-unit` | pure-logic behavior in isolation | `test-run-log` (unit) | — (but never satisfies any boundary below) |
| `browser` | user-visible UI behavior | `screenshot`, `recording` | unit `test-run-log` |
| `http-api` | request/response contract | `http-transcript` | unit `test-run-log` |
| `cli` | command behavior | `cli-output` | prose |
| `data` | persisted state | `db-query-output`, `state-dump` | unit `test-run-log` |
| `deploy-health` | a healthy running deployment | `deploy-log` | any pre-deploy artifact |
| `performance` | latency/throughput/frame timing | `perf-trace` (with methodology) | screenshot |
| `standards-compat` | conformance to an external standard | `cli-output` / `test-run-log` from the compat runner | assertion prose |

Reciprocal cross-link: the `verification` rule's artifact-type taxonomy is the source of the
establishing-evidence column above; that rule's reference body should point back here for the
boundary each type reaches. Cite these slugs, do not restate them: `verification` (the artifact-type
taxonomy), `factory-model` (operator-readable writing — rule 5), and `empirical-inquiry` (observe the
real result before claiming).

## The core inequality

The whole contract reduces to one inequality, stated explicitly so no surface can blur it:

**unit tests ≠ browser behavior ≠ healthy deployment ≠ standards compatibility.**

A passing unit `test-run-log` establishes only `code-unit` behavior. It can **never** establish a
`browser`, `http-api`, `deploy-health`, or `standards-compat` claim — those live at boundaries a
unit test does not reach. Unit tests are a *quality prerequisite* (they gate the commit); they are
not a *claim discharger* for any boundary above `code-unit`. Symmetrically, a green `deploy-log`
proves a healthy deployment but says nothing about whether the UI renders correctly, and a
`screenshot` proves the pixels but not the latency. Each boundary stands on its own evidence.

## The review-rejection rule

Citing evidence whose *kind* does not reach a claim's *boundary* is a **review-rejectable defect** —
a machine-checkable one once BCE-2's gate ships, and a review-rejectable one in prose review today.
"It passed unit tests" is not an answer to "does the button work in the browser." A reviewer rejects
the claim, names the boundary, and asks for evidence of a reaching kind.

## The claim fields

A claim is three fields, named here so BCE-2's schema reuses one spelling — this contract only
defines the names; it stores nothing:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `claim_id` | stable identifier for the claim being made |
| `boundary` | exactly one value from the claim-boundary taxonomy above |
| `required_evidence_kinds` | the evidence kind(s) that reach that boundary, from the `verification` artifact-type set |

A claim whose `required_evidence_kinds` has no captured, reaching artifact is **Not established** —
defined in full, with its evidence templates, in the section below. Artifact identity — what makes
two captured artifacts the same or different — is defined in the *Artifact identity* section below
(shipped by BCE-4, #1838). The bucket a security-sensitive claim lands in is defined in the *Security
buckets* section below (shipped by BCE-5, #1839). Where such a sibling surface is not installed in a
given branch, name what you can and continue.

### Worked example

```text
Claim: "The checkout button submits the order and shows a confirmation."

  boundary                 browser
  required_evidence_kinds  screenshot | recording

  Reaching evidence   A screenshot of the confirmation state after a real click, or a
                      recording of the click-through. EITHER establishes the browser claim.

  Non-reaching        A passing unit test-run-log for the submit handler. It establishes the
                      code-unit boundary only — the handler's logic in isolation — and can
                      NEVER establish this browser claim. Offered as proof here, it is a
                      review-rejectable defect; the claim stays Not established until a
                      screenshot or recording is captured.

Claim: "The service is deployed and healthy."

  boundary                 deploy-health
  required_evidence_kinds  deploy-log

  Non-reaching        Any pre-deploy artifact — a green CI test-run-log, a local screenshot.
                      A healthy deployment is established only by a deploy-log / health-check
                      response from the target environment.
```

## Artifact identity — what the evidence was collected against

A claim reaches only as far as its evidence's *kind*; it applies only to the *artifact* that evidence
was collected against. **Artifact identity is what makes two captured artifacts the same or
different**: one repository, at one commit, in one environment, at one moment. Evidence that does not
say which artifact it observed is not evidence about anything in particular — it silently transfers
to whatever ships next, which is exactly how an auto-merge race ships code no verification ever
touched.

Identity is carried in two places, and they must agree:

| Where | Field | What it pins |
|---|---|---|
| `artifact` (once per verdict) | `repository` | the `owner/repo` the run observed |
| | `base_sha` | the base the change was measured against |
| | `head_sha` | **the commit the verification actually observed** — required for a v2 pass |
| | `build_id` | the build/run the evidence came from, where one exists |
| | `environment` | where it ran (local, preview, staging, production) |
| | `observed_at` | when the run observed it (ISO-8601 UTC) |
| `evidence[]` (per artifact) | `artifact_head_sha` | the `head_sha` in force **when that artifact was captured** |
| | `sha256` | content digest of the committed evidence file |
| | `captured_at` | when that artifact was captured (ISO-8601 UTC) |

`head_sha` pins the *build*; `sha256` pins the *bytes*. Together they answer both identity questions:
"which artifact was this collected against" and "is this still the artifact that was collected". The
`sha256` + commit-ref discipline is the same one Lisa's upstream-evidence manifest already uses — it
is cited as prior art here, not reinvented.

### Two identity failures, both loud

- **`artifact_mismatch`** — an `evidence[]` entry whose `artifact_head_sha` differs from the verdict's
  `artifact.head_sha`. The evidence describes a different build than the one the verdict claims. The
  identity check fails **loudly, naming both SHAs** (the evidence's and the verdict's) so an operator
  can see which build each half is talking about.
- **`evidence_digest_mismatch`** — on read, recompute the `sha256` of each committed evidence file. If
  the bytes no longer match the recorded digest, the artifact has changed since it was recorded: the
  check fails, it names the evidence id, and blocks completion. A digest that cannot be recomputed
  (file absent) is the same failure.

Neither failure is ever summarized as "verification failed". Name the field, the ids, and both SHAs —
a person who does not code reads this at the gate (`factory-model` rule 5). Both checks are
**advisory-first**: reported to the operator but non-blocking until
`verification.gate.enforceBoundaries` is `true` in `.lisa.config.json` — the same ratchet flag the
boundary checks and the Stop-hook gate ride.

### The merge race — one definition, two guards

"The artifact that shipped" is already defined once, in `lisa-drive-pr-to-merge`: the **ancestry**
check (is the verified commit an ancestor of the merged base branch, and is the merge commit's parent
that verified head rather than a stale one) **plus** the **deploy-run** check (a deploy/release run
actually fired for the merge SHA or an including descendant). Cite that definition; never write a
second one. Identity reconciliation is the same definition read from the evidence side:

- Evidence collected on a **pre-merge head** is valid for the merge commit **only when that head is a
  parent of the merge** — i.e. it satisfies that skill's ancestry check against the merged head. If a
  late commit raced past the merge, the merged head is not the verified one and the evidence does not
  transfer.
- Ancestry alone is never enough. That skill's rule stands unchanged here: **never report shipped on
  ancestry alone** — the deploy-run check must also pass before completion is declared.
- On mismatch (`artifact.head_sha` ≠ the reconciled merge SHA), completion is not declared. Flag the
  mismatch naming both SHAs and **re-run verification against the merged head**; the re-run's verdict
  is what may declare completion.

Two guards, one definition — so they cannot disagree about what shipped.

## Security buckets — the impact-or-exploitability bar

A security-shaped claim is a claim like any other: it reaches only as far as its evidence. Applied to
security findings (shipped by BCE-5, #1839), that yields two buckets and one bar:

- **Security (proven)** — the finding carries **both** a `reproducer` (an evidence ref of a kind that
  reaches the claim's boundary, per the taxonomy above — e.g. an `http-transcript` for an injection
  claim at `http-api`) **and** a bounded `impact`/exploitability statement.
- **Security (unproven)** — **missing either**. It keeps a one-line `reason` and **stays in the
  security section**: a reproducer-less finding is **never auto-demoted** to a `maintenance` bucket,
  because under-reporting a real vulnerability is the worse failure.

The unproven bucket's label is the single configurable policy point —
`security.review.unprovenBucket` in `.lisa.config.json`, default `security-unproven`. An owner who
prefers true demotion flips that one value; no other classification logic changes. Like the boundary
checks, bucketing is **advisory** — it shapes the report, not the merge — until
`verification.gate.enforceBoundaries` is `true`.

The full procedure — per-finding fields, report shape, ZAP alignment — lives in the
`lisa-security-review` skill (with `lisa-security-zap-scan` citing it); dependency-CVE remediation
keeps its separate ladder in `security-audit-handling`. Cite those slugs; do not restate them here.

## The "Not established" section — required, never omitted

Every report that asserts something was verified also states, in the same breath, **what it did not
establish**. This is one section, it is **required**, and it is **never omitted and never blank** —
on the evidence comment, in the committed `evidence/<ticket>/verdict.json`, and in the
`verification-status.json` verdict BCE-2's gate reads.

**Where it appears and what it says**

| Surface | Shape |
|---|---|
| Evidence comment (tracker + PR `## Evidence` section) | a `## Not established` heading, one plain-language bullet per item |
| `evidence/<ticket>/verdict.json` | `not_established: []` plus `not_established_reviewed: true` |
| `.lisa/verification-status.json` (schema v2) | per-claim `not_established[]` plus the top-level `not_established_reviewed` flag |

**The empty case is not the omitted case.** A verification that genuinely left nothing unproved still
renders the heading, with the single line:

```text
## Not established

None outstanding — reviewed
```

An absent heading, or a heading with nothing under it, is a defect — it is indistinguishable from
never having asked the question. The list may be empty; the section may not be blank.

**Machine-readable semantics (as shipped by BCE-2, #1836).** `not_established` is the list — it may
be empty. `not_established_reviewed` is the boolean attestation that the list was actually
reviewed — **the flag may never be omitted**. That asymmetry is the whole mechanism: an empty list
plus a present flag means "we looked and found nothing outstanding"; an absent flag means nobody
looked. The Stop-hook gate treats an absent flag as a v2 contract violation, reported to stderr and
**advisory** until `verification.gate.enforceBoundaries` is `true` in `.lisa.config.json` (the same
ratchet flag the boundary checks ride); evidence surfaces refuse the post on the same terms.

**What belongs under the heading** — written in operator voice (`factory-model` rule 5: a person who
does not code reads this at the gate), not in engineering shorthand:

- **Boundaries not exercised** — a claim's boundary that no captured artifact reached. *"The checkout
  button was proved in the browser; the order's persisted row was never queried, so the `data`
  boundary is not established."*
- **Environments not tested** — where it was and was not run. *"Checked on production Chrome at
  1440×900 only. Not checked on mobile Safari, and not checked against the staging database."*
- **Claims consciously out of scope** — deliberately excluded behavior, named so nobody infers it.
  *"Refunds were not touched or tested; this change covers new orders only."*
- **Anything a green quality check might be mistaken for proving.** *"Unit tests pass for the submit
  handler. That establishes the code-unit boundary only — it is not evidence the button works."*

Each item names the thing, not a category: "not tested on mobile Safari" is usable at a gate; "some
environments untested" is not.

### Philosophical precedent for this section

This generalizes `lisa-improve-harness`'s **`Known limits`** field — a required, never-empty line on
every result record. That skill says it plainly:
*"A record with nothing in it is invalid on its face"* — because a single-trajectory loop always has
limits. The same is true of any verification:
it ran somewhere, on something, once. `Known limits` (one record) and `not_established` (every claim
in the factory) are the same discipline with the same never-empty rule; read either and you should
recognize the other.

## Philosophical precedent

This generalizes the **bounded-claim discipline** of `lisa-improve-harness`: one trajectory supports
one trajectory's claim, and a result record may claim only what its cited evidence reaches. Here the
same discipline is applied to every claim in the factory — a claim reaches exactly as far as the
*kind* of evidence behind it, and no further. The *Not established* half of that discipline is a
first-class report state — see the required, never-omitted section above.

## No behavior change; degrade, never block

This rule ships as documentation that later tickets make executable. It changes no schema, no gate,
and no skill. Where a surface it names (BCE-2's gate, BCE-3's templates) is not yet installed in a
given branch, name the boundary a claim reaches and continue — the contract never blocks on an absent
sibling surface. Every claim written under it must be operator-readable (`factory-model` rule 5): a
person who does not code should be able to read the boundary and see why the evidence does or does
not reach it.
