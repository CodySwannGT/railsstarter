## Reset/Seed Coverage & State Classification (load-bearing)

**Every persistent entity a project owns carries exactly one declared reset policy, and a work item that adds or changes persistent state is not done until the reset/seed contract covers it.** An entity the running system holds but the contract does not classify is a contract violation, and the check that finds it **fails closed** — an unclassified entity is never treated as safe to keep and never treated as safe to delete.

**One vendor-neutral contract, cited by** `lisa-research`, `lisa-acceptance-criteria`, `lisa-task-decomposition`, `lisa-test-strategy`, `lisa-implement`, `lisa-codify-verification`, `lisa-verification-lifecycle`, and `lisa-verify` (the `leaf-only-lifecycle` / `repo-scope-split` precedent: one shared slug, never divergent per-skill prose). It never names a database engine, cloud, identity provider, or test runner — those are project configuration.

## Why this exists

Test suites create state. Without a contract, cleanup is a habit: a flow creates a uniquely-marked record and deletes it on the happy path only, so every early failure leaks one more. Nothing sweeps it, nothing complains, and the suite degrades until someone reads a flake as a product bug. The observed shape is always the same — leaked records accumulate silently until a list view, a uniqueness constraint, or a count assertion breaks. Per-flow self-cleanup is not coverage; it is the failure mode.

## Membership

Membership is **state, not repo name, ticket label, or storage engine**: an entity is in scope the moment something the project writes **outlives the process that wrote it**. That includes rows and tables, but rows are only one kind of state. Also in scope: identity-provider objects (accounts, groups, memberships, sessions), object storage (buckets, prefixes, uploaded files), search indexes, queues and topics (in-flight and dead-letter), caches with a persistence tier, materialized/derived views and projections, feature-flag and configuration overrides, scheduled jobs created at runtime, and analytics or third-party side effects a run leaves behind. Out of scope: values that live only in memory for the duration of one process.

A work item is in scope when it **adds** such an entity, **changes what owns or writes** one, or **changes the lifetime** of one. Renames count as changes, not as new entities plus deletions.

## The four policies

Every entity is classified as exactly one of:

- **`fixture-owned`** — the reset may create, mutate, and delete rows here, but only those it owns. Ownership is declared as a predicate (a reserved id shape, a reserved account or namespace, a marker attribute), never as "everything in this entity."
- **`preserve`** — the reset must leave this untouched. Catalog, reference data, anything a migration seeds, anything expensive or impossible to rebuild, and any state belonging to someone who is not the fixture.
- **`derived-rebuild`** — not authored by anyone; recomputed from its sources after the reset (projections, materialized views, search indexes, caches). The reset rebuilds it rather than clearing or preserving it, and proves it converged.
- **`forbidden`** — the reset must be structurally unable to touch it: ledgers, payments, wallets, withdrawals, audit trails, anything irreversible. Declaring `forbidden` obliges naming the enforcement outside the script — a least-privilege role, a revoked grant, a separate account or credential boundary — because a script-only promise dies in the refactor that drops the safe caller.

**Classify by provenance, never by observation.** "The table looked empty" is not evidence it is unused; runtime statistics are approximations, and a table that has never been analyzed reports rows it holds. Ask who writes it and whether anything can put it back.

## Keep-lists are a detector, not the safety model

Deriving the clear-list by subtracting a keep-list from a schema listing is a **useful detector** — run it, and let it flag entities the contract has not seen. It is not the boundary. It cannot model renames, multiple schemas, framework-generated entities, views, partitions, row-level ownership, or any of the non-DB state above, and "new entities are cleared unless exempted" erases unrelated data the first time something adds one. The boundary is the classification; subtraction only tells you the classification is stale.

## Required assurances

A reset contract is not complete until it declares, and points at evidence for, all of: non-fixture and catalog data survive; reserved fixture identifiers are rejected on collision with anything real; foreign references into preserved entities are refused rather than cascaded; every write is **acknowledged** (a mutation reported by the caller and not confirmed by the system is a failure, not a success); a second apply converges to the same state and reports no further change; the post-state is verified by **exact expected counts**, not "at least one"; and production fails closed with no override of any kind. Where the platform can enforce a boundary with roles, grants, or constraints, it does — the in-process guard remains as defense in depth, never as the primary control.

## Definition of done

A work item that adds or changes persistent state is not done until: (1) every entity it introduces or changes is classified in the project's state contract with a reason and an owner; (2) `fixture-owned` entities it introduces declare their ownership predicate **and** are actually swept by the reset — an entity a suite creates but nothing removes is the leak this rule exists to prevent; (3) `preserve`/`forbidden` entities it introduces name their enforcement; (4) any seed the suite depends on covers the new state, with the verify step asserting exact counts; and (5) the state-classification check passes in the same PR. **A missing or stale classification is a verification failure, not a warning** — it blocks completion exactly as a `PARTIAL` spec-conformance verdict does, and is never demoted to "optional", "if cheap", or a follow-up without a linked build-ready ticket created before merge.

## Bootstrap, noop, and degradation

A project with no state contract yet is not exempt: the first work item touching persistent state scaffolds the minimum (the contract file, its own entities classified, the check wired into CI) and covers **its own** state. It never backfills the whole system — pre-existing unclassified entities are recorded as burndown with an owner and a date, not treated as this item's blocker. A project that genuinely holds no persistent state declares a **machine-readable noop** (`mode: "declared-noop"` with reason, owner, and a capability-manifest reference) which the check verifies against the repo rather than taking on faith — a bare exit 0 is indistinguishable from a successful destructive run and never satisfies this rule. A project that cannot produce a runtime inventory records the checked sources and the absence, exactly as the regression-spec absence path in `verification` does; a silent skip is never one of the exits.

## Command envelope

Every reset, seed, verify, inventory, and classification adapter answers the **same interface** — one validated JSON result on stdout, exit 0 only when the operation both completed **and** verified, `--dry-run` mandatory before anything destructive, and a requested stage always re-checked against server-resolved identity rather than trusted. The envelope is specified in the reference body and is what makes "every repo answers the same question the same way" checkable instead of aspirational.

**The production arm of this is executable, not advisory.** `scripts/lisa-destructive-guard.mjs` ships to every adopter and is wired into the envelope itself: a destructive run against a production-resolved — or unresolvable — environment has **no representable success envelope**, so it can never exit 0, and there is no parameter, field, or environment variable anywhere in the guard that changes the answer. A dry run is not an exemption, and `--dry-run` is the default rather than an opt-in. Read this as what it is: a check at the one interface every adapter passes through, which an adapter that misreports its own environment still defeats. The end state is a destructive capability that is **not deployed to production at all** — non-existence beats refusal — and that design, with the failure modes it must still close, is recorded in `docs/design/reset-production-absence.md`.

---

Automated suites create state, and the state outlives them. The historical pattern is per-flow
self-cleanup: a flow creates a uniquely-marked record at the top and deletes it as its last step, so
the record survives every failure that happens in between. Nothing sweeps the survivors and nothing
reports them, so the leak is invisible until a list view, a uniqueness constraint, a pagination
boundary, or an exact-count assertion breaks — at which point it presents as a product bug or an
unreproducible flake. The same story has now played out on several entity types in several
codebases, always with the same three ingredients: state a suite creates, cleanup that only runs on
the happy path, and no inventory that would have noticed.

This contract removes the discipline requirement. Instead of asking every author to remember to
sweep what they created, it makes the *absence* of a decision a failing check.

It is a **single vendor-neutral contract** consumed by `lisa-research` (specs state what persistent
state the work introduces), `lisa-acceptance-criteria` and `lisa-task-decomposition` (the
classification and the sweep are explicit deliverables on the work item, not implied work),
`lisa-test-strategy` and `lisa-implement` (building the item includes both),
`lisa-codify-verification` (the verify step asserts the post-reset baseline), and
`lisa-verification-lifecycle` / `lisa-verify` (the check is run, and a miss fails the item). Those
skills cite this slug; they do not restate it.

## Vendor neutrality is the point

This contract never names a database engine, a cloud, an identity provider, an object store, a
search engine, a queue, or a test runner. Projects use different ones, several at once, and change
them without touching this contract. What is fixed is the *obligation*: every entity that holds
state across process boundaries carries exactly one policy, and the running system's inventory is
compared against that declaration.

The words "table" and "row" appear in this document only as examples. An entity is anything with a
durable identity and a lifetime: a table, a collection, a bucket prefix, an index, a topic, a
user-pool group, a materialized view, a scheduled job.

## Why "new entities are cleared by default" is the wrong safety model

An earlier version of this pattern derived the clear-list by subtracting a hand-maintained keep-list
from a schema listing: anything new is cleared unless someone deliberately exempts it. It is
attractive because it fails toward action, and the failure it prevents (a new entity silently
accumulating) is real. It is still wrong as the *boundary*, for reasons that are structural rather
than stylistic:

- **It erases unrelated data on first contact.** The first change that adds an entity nobody has
  classified deletes its contents on the next run, in whatever non-production environment happened
  to run first. "Non-production" is not "worthless" — shared development environments hold hand-built
  scenarios, support reproductions, and partner sandboxes.
- **A migrations-directory diff does not model reality.** It cannot see renames (which read as one
  deletion plus one unclassified addition), multiple schemas or namespaces, framework- or
  ORM-generated entities that no migration file names, views, partitions and inheritance children,
  entities created by a deploy rather than a migration, or row-level ownership — the common case
  where an entity holds both fixture rows and rows that must survive.
- **It only sees the database.** Identity-provider accounts, object-storage prefixes, search indexes,
  queue backlogs, and third-party side effects are invisible to it, and those are precisely where
  leaked test state is most expensive.

Subtraction survives in this contract as a **detector**: run it, and treat every entity it finds
that the contract has not classified as a finding. The safety decision is the classification.

## The state contract

Default location `state/state-contract.json` (a project with an equivalent artifact keeps its own
path and records it in `.lisa.config.json`). It is checked in, reviewed like code, and versioned:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `schemaVersion` | The schema this document conforms to. Pinned; a bump is a deliberate migration. |
| `contractVersion` | The project's own version for *its* declared state. Bumped whenever policies or ownership predicates change, so evidence from one run cannot be read as evidence for a different contract. |
| `mode` | `contract` (the normal case) or `declared-noop`. |
| `owner` | Who answers questions about this file. A team or role, not an individual's personal account. |
| `environments` | The environments a reset may target, and the identity source each is resolved from. Never a list the caller can extend at runtime. |
| `fixtureIdentity` | How fixture-owned records are recognized: reserved id shape, reserved account/namespace, marker attribute. This is the ownership predicate the whole model rests on. |
| `entities[]` | One entry per persistent entity. |
| `assurances` | The required properties below, each with a pointer to the evidence that proves it. |
| `waivers[]` | Dated IOUs for entities that genuinely cannot be classified yet. |

Each `entities[]` entry carries `id` (stable, fully qualified — namespace plus name), `kind` (the
project's own vocabulary for what sort of state it is), `policy` (one of the four), `reason` (why,
in one sentence a reviewer can check), `owner`, and policy-specific obligations:

- `fixture-owned` → `ownership` (the predicate identifying rows/objects the reset may delete) and
  `sweptBy` (the routine that removes them). An entity classified `fixture-owned` with no sweep is
  the exact leak this rule exists to catch and fails the check.
- `preserve` → `reason` must name the provenance (migration-seeded, ingested catalog, human-authored,
  belongs to a real person) and, where available, `enforcedBy`.
- `derived-rebuild` → `rebuiltFrom` (the sources) and `rebuiltBy` (the routine). The reset rebuilds
  and proves convergence rather than clearing.
- `forbidden` → `enforcedBy` is **required** and must name a control outside the reset process: a
  least-privilege role, a revoked grant, a separate credential or account boundary, a database
  constraint. "The script does not touch it" is not an enforcement.

### Waivers are dated IOUs, never classifications

An entity nobody can classify today is recorded with its id, a reason, an owner, a ticket, and a
`recordedAt` date. It stays visible in the report, it never counts as classified, and it never
authorizes the reset to touch the entity — a waived entity is treated as `preserve` for safety while
remaining a finding. A waiver is invalid, and fails the check, when it names an entity that is not in
the inventory, duplicates an existing classification, or carries no owner, ticket, or date.

## The check

The check compares a **runtime inventory** — what the system actually holds, enumerated from the
running environment — against the contract. Static sources are inputs to discovery, never a
substitute for the inventory: the whole point is to catch what the repository does not describe.

Semantics, in order:

1. **Contract absent** → `not-adopted`. Reported visibly, exits 0, and the context is not required.
   Adoption is an explicit act; a not-yet-adopted repo is not silently passing a gate it never wired.
2. **Contract malformed, unparseable, or failing schema validation** → fail. A broken contract is
   never treated as an empty one.
3. **`mode: "declared-noop"`** → the noop must carry a reason, an owner, and a capability-manifest
   reference, **and** the detectors must find no persistence signals in the repository. A repo with
   persistence cannot declare a reset noop; the check rejects it rather than trusting the
   declaration.
4. **Entity in the inventory with no classification and no waiver** → **fail closed**, naming the
   entity. This is the primary failure this contract exists to produce.
5. **Entity classified but absent from the inventory** → fail as stale, unless the entry is marked
   retired with a date. A contract that describes a system that no longer exists is not protection.
6. **Policy obligations unmet** — `fixture-owned` with no ownership predicate or no sweep,
   `forbidden` with no external enforcement, `derived-rebuild` with no rebuild routine → fail.
7. **A required assurance missing or unevidenced** → fail.
8. **Detector findings that the inventory did not surface** (a schema or migration source naming an
   entity the inventory did not return) → fail, because it means the inventory is incomplete and
   every other conclusion is unsound.
9. **No inventory available** → `detection-only`. The detectors run, findings are reported, and the
   result is explicitly labeled non-authoritative. It never reports the same status as a verified
   run, and it never satisfies the definition of done on its own.

Every exit path emits the standard command envelope, so a caller can tell "verified clean" from
"could not look" without parsing prose.

### Non-database discovery

The inventory is only complete when it enumerates every kind of state the project holds. At minimum,
discovery asks each of these and records either the enumeration or a documented absence: identity
provider (accounts, groups, memberships, long-lived sessions and devices), object storage (buckets
and prefixes written by the app or by tests), search indexes and their aliases, queues and topics
including dead-letter backlogs, caches with a persistence tier, derived views and projections,
runtime-created scheduled jobs and webhooks, feature-flag and configuration overrides, and outbound
side effects (email, SMS, billing, analytics events, third-party records). "We checked and there is
none" is an acceptable answer and must be written down; not asking is not.

## Required assurances

These are the properties a reset must have. Each is declared in `assurances` with a pointer to the
test, guard, or role that proves it — a declaration with no evidence pointer fails the check.

| Assurance | What it means | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `preserves-non-fixture-data` | Catalog, reference, and any non-fixture data survive a reset unchanged. | The expensive-to-rebuild data is usually the data a blunt reset destroys, and it is often not restorable by re-running any seed in the repo. |
| `rejects-reserved-id-collision` | A reserved fixture identifier that collides with a real record aborts rather than overwriting. | The ownership predicate is the entire safety boundary; a collision means it is no longer identifying. |
| `rejects-foreign-references` | A fixture record referencing a preserved record it does not own is refused, never cascaded. | Cascades are how a fixture-scoped delete reaches outside its scope. |
| `requires-write-acknowledgment` | Every mutation is confirmed by the system, not assumed from a returned status. | An unacknowledged write is an unknown state, and "unknown" reported as success is how a half-applied reset becomes a mystery failure downstream. |
| `converges-on-second-apply` | Applying twice produces the same state and the second run reports no further change. | Convergence is what makes the reset safe to re-run, and re-running is what makes partial failure recoverable. |
| `verifies-exact-counts` | Verification asserts the exact expected count per fixture entity. | "At least one" passes against a leak. Exact counts are what detect one. |
| `production-fails-closed` | Production is refused with no override, escape hatch, or environment variable that changes the answer. | A single variable that authorizes production mutation will eventually be set by something that is not a person. |
| `guard-at-the-choke-point` | The environment check runs immediately before every outbound mutation, not only at startup. | A startup-only check does not survive a refactor that adds a second code path. |
| `enumerates-before-mutating` | `--dry-run` enumerates exactly what would change and fails on anything whose ownership it cannot establish. | Unknown ownership must block, not default to delete. |

Prefer platform enforcement over process enforcement wherever it exists: a role that cannot see the
forbidden entities, grants revoked rather than merely unused, constraints that make a cross-boundary
reference impossible, separate credentials per environment. A test proves the code behaves today; a
revoked grant makes the behavior unavailable.

## Standard command envelope

Every adapter in this family — reset, seed, verify, inventory, classification check — returns **one**
JSON object on stdout and nothing else. Human-readable narration goes to stderr, redacted of secrets
and personal data.

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": "lisa-command-envelope-v1",
  "capability": "<reset|seed|reset-verify|state-inventory|state-classification|...>",
  "mode": "<real|declared-noop|not-applicable>",
  "operation": "<the operation performed>",
  "environment": "<server-resolved environment identity>",
  "contractVersion": "<the project's state-contract version>",
  "dryRun": true,
  "status": "<completed|no-op|denied|invalid|failed|verification-mismatch|not-adopted|detection-only>",
  "correlationId": "<stable id joining logs, audit records, and CI output>",
  "summary": { "deleted": 0, "created": 0, "preserved": 0 }
}
```

Rules that make the envelope load-bearing rather than decorative:

- **Exit 0 means completed *and* verified.** Any nonzero exit means denied, invalid, failed, or
  verification-mismatch, and the envelope's `status` says which. An adapter that mutated successfully
  but could not verify exits nonzero.
- **`--dry-run` is mandatory for every destructive adapter**, enumerates the intended mutations, and
  fails on any entity whose ownership it cannot establish.
- **`--stage` (or equivalent) is a *request*, never the source of truth.** The adapter resolves the
  environment from server-side deployment identity and fails if the request disagrees. A
  caller-supplied stage, URL, host, or public build-time variable never authorizes a destructive
  operation.
- **`--idempotency-key` is required in CI**, so a retried invocation is recognized rather than
  repeated.
- **A noop returns `mode: "declared-noop"`** with a reason, an owner, and a capability-manifest
  reference. A bare exit 0 with no envelope is indistinguishable from a successful destructive run
  and is never an acceptable noop.
- **`correlationId` appears in the envelope, the audit record, and the CI log**, so a run can be
  reconstructed after the fact.
- The audit record for a destructive run additionally names the actor, the CI run, the resolved
  environment and account, the contract version, and before/after counts — and contains no secrets
  or personal data.

## Bootstrap procedure

1. Enumerate the runtime inventory from a non-production environment, including the non-database
   sources listed above. Record what could not be enumerated and why.
2. Classify every entity. Start from provenance: who writes it, and can anything put it back? Prefer
   `preserve` when unsure — an over-preserved entity leaks; an over-cleared one destroys.
3. Declare `fixtureIdentity` and the ownership predicate before classifying anything as
   `fixture-owned`.
4. Write the assurances with pointers to the tests or roles that prove them. Missing evidence is a
   work item, not a field to leave blank.
5. Wire the check into CI so the next unclassified entity fails the pull request that introduces it.
6. Record everything still unclassified as dated waivers with owners, and burn them down.

The first work item does not backfill the whole system. It classifies what it touches, scaffolds the
file, and turns the check on; everything else is burndown that stays visible.

## What this contract does not do

It does not decide *how* a reset is executed, where it runs, or what invokes it. It does not
prescribe intra-run isolation. It does not replace a threat model for a destructive control plane —
where a reset is reachable from CI, that control plane has its own security obligations (identity,
least privilege, leases, audit) which this contract assumes rather than specifies. What it
guarantees is narrower and load-bearing: **no persistent state exists in the system that nobody has
decided about, and no work item adds some without saying so.**
