# Upstream To Lisa

A root cause in a Lisa-distributed artifact determines the destination of a worthwhile repair. First apply `do-it-now`'s **Worth doing** guidance. Ownership, a missing guard, or a reproducible edge case alone does not justify another issue.

## Accepted repairs

A concrete delivery failure, credible material safety risk, or recurring costly friction in a Lisa template, rule, skill, agent, hook, or CI workflow belongs upstream.

| Template class | Local fix survives `lisa apply`? | Why repair upstream? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **copy-overwrite** | No | Prevent the local repair being replaced by the broken source. |
| **create-only** | Yes | Stop new projects inheriting the defect. |

A header saying `Lisa will not overwrite it` is a positive upstream ownership signal, not a reason to keep an accepted defect local. It does not establish priority or value.

1. **Unblock the current task if needed.** Apply the smallest safe local stopgap. Keep it scoped and attributable; do not stall useful delivery waiting for an upstream release.
2. **Search before filing.** Search open AND closed issues in the configured upstream repository (`hardening.upstreamRepo`, default `CodySwannGT/lisa`). Reuse a matching open issue. Honor **Not planned** decisions under `rejection-detection`'s **Proposal rejection memory**, including legacy unmarked issues. Check actual behavior before treating a completed issue as a regression.
3. **File only the accepted work.** Use `lisa-github-write-issue` against the upstream repository, with the explicit readiness declaration from `ready-role-filing`. State the owning source, observed consequence or credible risk, smallest durable fix, and any local stopgap. Follow the public-safe attribution/projection procedure; never publish host names, credentials, or private source paths.

Bundle related minor repairs into one bounded maintenance item when the combined benefit warrants it. Declined observations require no ticket or escalation. A generalizable governance pattern still has to justify its recurring cost across consumers; generality alone is insufficient.

## Access and scope

If an accepted upstream repair cannot be filed because access is missing, prepare the public-safe issue and explain the access problem. Do not ask a human to file observations already declined on value.

Do not mistake editing an installed artifact for changing Lisa's source. Inside Lisa itself, use the existing tracked task, repair the shared source, and regenerate equivalent agent surfaces; no second upstream issue is needed.
