## BDD Behavior Contract & E2E Coverage (load-bearing)

**Every frontend work item ships its behavior as Gherkin scenarios with stable IDs, and seals each required scenario-platform obligation with aligned e2e automation in the project's configured runner for that platform.** A frontend change that adds no scenario, or a required scenario-platform obligation with neither a mapped test nor a dated waiver, is a contract violation.

**One vendor-neutral contract, cited by** `lisa-research`, `lisa-acceptance-criteria`, `lisa-task-decomposition`, `lisa-test-strategy`, `lisa-tdd-implementation`, `lisa-implement`, `lisa-codify-verification`, `lisa-verification-lifecycle`, `lisa-spec-conformance`, and `lisa-verify` (the `leaf-only-lifecycle` / `repo-scope-split` precedent: one shared slug, never divergent per-skill prose).

## Membership

Membership is **surface, not repo name or ticket label**: a work item is frontend-type the moment it adds or changes something a user can observe — a screen, route, component, interaction, visual state, empty/error/loading state, navigation path, or copy a user reads. It applies on every platform the project ships. Backend-only, infrastructure, docs, tooling, and refactors with no user-observable delta are out; a refactor that changes what the user sees is in.

## The contract lives in the repo

Default locations (a project that already has an equivalent contract keeps its own paths and records them in `.lisa.config.json`):

| Artifact | Default path | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| Scenarios | `bdd/features/*.feature` | Gherkin, the product-level behavior contract |
| Coverage map | `bdd/coverage-map.json` | scenario → runner/platform/file/evidence mappings, plus waivers, per-runner test-discovery roots, and exclusions |
| Generated matrix | `docs/bdd-scenario-matrix.md` | regenerated, never hand-edited |
| Burndown | `docs/e2e-bdd-coverage.md` | current coverage per platform |

## Scenario shape

Every scenario carries **one stable `@BDD-<DOMAIN>-<NNN>` ID**, the platforms it requires (`@web`, `@ios`, `@android`, … as the project declares them), provenance (design node, ratified decision), and a tracker tag tying it to the work item that introduced or changed it. IDs are never renumbered or reused: behavior that stays user-observably the same keeps its ID through a rewrite; genuinely different behavior gets a new ID and the old one is marked `@superseded`.

Lifecycle tag, exactly one or none:

- **no tag** — ratified and required; it is in the coverage denominator.
- **`@blocked`** — specified but awaiting a decision or dependency; the *product* does not do this yet.
- **`@reference-only`** — intentionally not authoritative.
- **`@superseded`** — replaced by a ratified rule or a newer scenario.

The last three are out of the denominator. Deleting a committed capability to make coverage look better is a violation; mark it, do not drop it.

## What seals a scenario

Coverage is counted per **required scenario-platform obligation**, and an obligation is sealed only by **aligned e2e automation in the project's configured runner for that platform** — the runner→platform mapping is project configuration (e.g. a web runner covering `web`, a device runner covering `ios`/`android`), never named by this contract. A unit test, a route boot, a screenshot, a fixture, an API test, or a passing test on a *different* platform never seals an obligation: they prove something else. Each mapping names the runner, the platforms, the file, and the evidence string inside it, so the gate can prove the mapping still resolves.

**The gate reads in both directions.** It also walks the test roots the project declares per runner, so an e2e test that exists but that the contract never mentions is a violation — map it to a scenario, or record an exclusion stating why it aligns to no product behavior. Roots are configuration: a subflow or helper directory left undeclared is structurally invisible, which is the same failure as having no gate for it.

**Waivers are dated IOUs, never coverage.** An obligation whose runner genuinely cannot decide it today (no camera on the simulator, no request interception, no provisioned provider credential) is recorded with scenario, platforms, reason, and `recordedAt`. It leaves the denominator; it never counts as covered, and nothing about it asserts the behavior works. A waiver is invalid — and fails the gate — when it names a nonexistent scenario or an undeclared platform, covers an already-excluded scenario, or masks a scenario-platform that already has a mapping. Revisit a waiver when its reason dies.

## Definition of done

A frontend work item is not done until: (1) every user-facing behavior it adds or changes exists as a Gherkin scenario with a stable ID in the project's behavior contract, traceable to the work item; (2) every required scenario-platform obligation it introduces is either mapped to aligned e2e automation in the project's configured runner for that platform, or carries a dated waiver naming the runner limitation; and (3) the coverage gate passes and the generated matrix and burndown are regenerated and committed in the same PR. **Missing BDD coverage is a verification failure, not a warning** — it blocks completion exactly as a `PARTIAL` spec-conformance verdict does, and it is never demoted to "optional", "if cheap", or a follow-up without a linked build-ready ticket created before merge.

## Bootstrap and degradation

A project with no `bdd/` contract yet is not exempt — the first frontend work item scaffolds the minimum (features dir, coverage map with the project's detected runner→platform mapping, gate + matrix scripts) and covers **its own** behavior. It never backfills the whole app: pre-existing uncovered behavior is recorded as burndown, not treated as this item's blocker. If no e2e runner exists for a required platform at all, record the checked locations and the absence as the reason, exactly as the regression-spec absence path in `verification` does — a silent skip is never one of the exits.

---

Frontend behavior has historically been specified twice and owned nowhere: once as prose acceptance
criteria on a ticket that closes and disappears, and once as whatever e2e tests someone had time to
write. Neither survives the work item. The cost lands at verification time — nobody can answer "what
is this app supposed to do?" without re-reading a year of closed tickets, and "is that behavior
guarded?" has a different answer shape per platform and per runner. This contract writes both
answers down once, in the repo, next to the code.

It is a **single vendor-neutral contract** consumed by `lisa-research` (PRDs express frontend
behavior in a BDD-convertible shape), `lisa-acceptance-criteria` and `lisa-task-decomposition`
(the contract update and the e2e sealing are explicit obligations on the work item, not implied
work), `lisa-test-strategy` and `lisa-tdd-implementation` and `lisa-implement` (building a frontend
item includes both), `lisa-codify-verification` (the verified journey is codified into every runner
the scenario's platforms require), and `lisa-verification-lifecycle` / `lisa-spec-conformance` /
`lisa-verify` (the gate is checked, and a miss fails the item). Those skills cite this slug; they do
not restate it.

## Vendor neutrality is the point

This contract never names a test runner. Projects use Playwright, Cypress, Maestro, Detox, Appium,
WebdriverIO, XCUITest, Espresso, an in-house harness, or several at once, and that choice is
project configuration that changes without touching this contract. What the contract fixes is the
*obligation*: a required scenario-platform pair is sealed by aligned automation **in whatever runner
the project has configured for that platform**. Any tool named anywhere downstream is an example,
never a mandate.

The runner→platform mapping is declared once, in the coverage map, and is the only place a tool name
is authoritative:

```json
"runnerPlatforms": {
  "<web-runner>": ["web"],
  "<device-runner>": ["ios", "android"]
}
```

Platform vocabulary is the project's own — a project that ships only web declares only `web`; one
that ships a desktop or TV surface declares those. The contract cares that each scenario names the
platforms it requires and that each named platform has a configured runner.

## Coverage map schema

`bdd/coverage-map.json` is the machine-readable half of the contract. Minimum shape:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "asOf": "<ISO date>",
  "runnerPlatforms": { "<runner>": ["<platform>", "..."] },
  "coverageFloor": { "<platform>": "<0-100, an absolute bar checked in enforced mode — not a ratchet, set once and left alone>" },
  "platformWaivers": [
    {
      "scenario": "BDD-DOMAIN-NNN",
      "platforms": ["<platform>"],
      "runner": "<runner>",
      "reason": "why this runner cannot decide this behavior today",
      "owner": "verification-team",
      "ticket": "gh-123",
      "recordedAt": "2026-09-12",
      "expiresAt": "2026-10-12"
    }
  ],
  "mappings": [
    {
      "scenario": "BDD-DOMAIN-NNN",
      "runner": "<runner>",
      "platforms": ["<platform>", "..."],
      "file": "<path to the spec/flow>",
      "evidence": "<exact string inside that file — the test title or flow name>",
      "level": "behavioral"
    }
  ],
  "testDiscovery": {
    "<runner>": {
      "roots": ["<repo-relative directory>", "..."],
      "extensions": [".<suffix>", "..."],
      "ignore": ["<optional repo-relative path prefix>"],
      "evidence": { "kind": "call-title", "functions": ["test", "it"] }
    }
  },
  "exclusions": [
    {
      "file": "<path>",
      "evidence": "<optional exact title; omit to excuse the whole file>",
      "reason": "why this test aligns to no product behavior"
    }
  ]
}
```

The waiver's owner, ticket, and dates are illustrative values: substitute the responsible person
or team, the real follow-up reference (`gh-123` or `PROJ-123` shape), and a current, bounded
`YYYY-MM-DD` review window. Name a runner from `runnerPlatforms`; it is required when more than
one runner covers the waived platform. An expired waiver is rejected, and a waiver is never coverage.

`evidence` is what makes a mapping falsifiable: the gate reads the mapped file and confirms the
string is still there, so renaming or deleting a test breaks the map loudly instead of leaving a
scenario silently unguarded.

One behavior may have multiple aligned tests in the same runner. Record each distinct file/evidence
pair as a mapping; the obligation counts once for traceability, while every test remains separately
falsifiable and can join to its own execution result. Only an exact repeated mapping is a duplicate.

`testDiscovery` closes the other direction. Validating only what the map DECLARES can never see a
test file nobody declared, so the gate walks the project's own roots and requires **every test it
finds to be named by a mapping or excused by an exclusion**. Roots and the evidence grammar are
per-runner configuration — list every directory, including subflow and helper directories, because
a directory omitted here is structurally invisible to the gate. Evidence grammars are an allowlist
of two (`call-title` reads `test("…")`-style declarations and known test modifiers while ignoring
suite/helper calls such as `test.describe` and `test.step`, and reads titles from curried
parameterized declarations such as `test.each(table)("title")` and `it.each`; `line-field` reads a leading `name:`
field), never a project-supplied regular expression, and a template-literal title is used verbatim
from the source rather than rewritten. A missing block is a defect in enforced mode
(`discovery-missing`); a malformed one is refused in **every** state (`discovery-invalid`), because
discovery that silently finds nothing looks exactly like a clean repo.

`exclusions` records tests that deliberately map to nothing — starter templates, source-level
corroboration — so "unmapped test" stays a meaningful signal. Each entry states a `reason`, and an
exclusion whose file is gone, whose title was renamed, or that no discovery root covers is
`exclusion-stale`: a standing claim about nothing, never a permanent excuse.

## The gate

Two commands, wired into the project's script surface and into CI:

1. **Regenerate** — recompute coverage from features + map, rewrite the generated matrix
   (`docs/bdd-scenario-matrix.md`) and the burndown (`docs/e2e-bdd-coverage.md`), and refresh the
   machine-readable report. Low coverage is reported honestly and does **not** fail this command.
2. **Check** — the CI gate. It fails on contract defects, not on ambition:
   - a duplicate or malformed scenario ID;
   - a scenario declaring a platform with no configured runner;
   - a mapping whose file is missing or whose `evidence` string is gone (stale mapping);
   - a mapping claiming a platform the scenario does not declare;
   - an invalid waiver (nonexistent scenario, undeclared platform, already-excluded scenario, a
     `runner` that does not cover the waived platform under `runnerPlatforms`, or one that masks an
     existing mapping);
   - a discovered test named by no mapping and no exclusion, or an exclusion that no longer excuses
     anything;
   - a platform sitting below its committed `coverageFloor`;
   - coverage given back: an obligation mapped at the base revision that nothing maps here;
   - new behavior nobody mapped or waived.

   Regeneration is never blocked by the check: `--write` rewrites the report and burndown whenever a
   report can be built at all, so a stale evidence string can never hold hostage the paperwork that
   documents it.

The percentage measures **aligned automation inventory, not the latest run result**. A mapped test
that currently fails is a red CI check, a separate signal; the map only asserts the automation
exists and still says what it claimed. Both facts are required — a green gate over a red suite is
not coverage.

### Coverage floor, not coverage target — and not a ratchet

Projects adopting this contract mid-life start below 100% and must not be blocked by that. The
committed `coverageFloor` per platform is an **absolute bar** answering "is this platform below it
right now". Set it once at adoption to the honest measured number (or `0`) and leave it: nothing
forces it upward, and lowering it needs no ceremony.

What stops coverage sliding backwards is checked directly, per obligation, against the base
revision — **an obligation that was mapped may not stop being mapped, and new behavior arrives
mapped or waived**. Giving coverage back is legitimate but takes a recorded route: a complete `retirements`
record (for a behavior the product no longer has) or a `platformWaivers` entry (for a runner
that cannot decide it). Gaps that predate the change are burndown, never a
gate failure — which is what lets a brownfield project adopt `enforced` without first backfilling
its whole history.

## Waivers versus `@blocked`

These are different failures and must never be conflated:

| | Means | Recorded as |
|---|---|---|
| `@blocked` | The **product** does not do this yet — undesigned, undecided, or unbuilt. | Lifecycle tag on the scenario |
| Waiver | The product may well do it, but this **runner** cannot decide it on this platform today. | Dated entry in `platformWaivers` |

Both leave the denominator, and neither is ever counted as covered: a waiver is a dated IOU, never
coverage. A waiver names a runner limitation — no camera on
the simulator, no request interception, a provider sign-in needing a real credential nobody
provisioned, a backend with no seedable row for the required state — and it carries a date so it can
be audited for age. When the limitation dies, the waiver is deleted and the automation is written;
a waiver that outlives its reason is a defect the burndown should surface.

## Scenario identity and change

A stable ID is a promise about *behavior*, not about text:

- The user-observable behavior is unchanged → **keep the ID**, however much the wording, the
  implementation, or the design node changed.
- The behavior is genuinely different → **new ID**; mark the old one `@superseded` and leave it in
  the file. Superseded scenarios are the audit trail for why the product changed.
- The capability is committed but not yet designed or built → write it now and tag it `@blocked`.
  Omitting a committed capability makes coverage look better by describing less of the product,
  which is exactly the failure this contract exists to prevent.
- IDs are never renumbered or reused. Gaps in the sequence are normal and harmless.

Provenance tags tie a scenario back to its authority (design node, ratified decision, wiki
requirement) and to the tracker item that introduced or changed it, so `spec-conformance` can walk
from a requirement to a scenario to a test without guessing.

## Per-flow obligations

| Flow | Obligation |
|---|---|
| **Research / PRD** | For frontend scope, user-facing behavior is written as — or in a shape directly convertible to — Given/When/Then scenarios, with the platforms each behavior must hold on. A PRD that describes frontend behavior only as narrative forces the shape to be invented later, inconsistently. |
| **Plan / decomposition / acceptance criteria** | Each frontend work item's acceptance criteria and Validation Journey name the contract update *and* the e2e sealing as explicit deliverables, with the scenario IDs it will add or change once known. They are line items, not implied work. |
| **Implement / TDD / test strategy** | Building the item updates `bdd/features` and the coverage map and writes the aligned automation, in the same PR as the behavior. The scenario is the RED test's specification for user-facing behavior. |
| **Codify verification** | The verified journey is codified into **every runner the scenario's platforms require** — one runner is never a substitute for another, because they guard different platforms of the same behavior. |
| **Verify / verification-lifecycle / spec-conformance** | Verification confirms scenarios exist for the shipped behavior and the coverage gate passes. A shipped frontend behavior with no scenario, or a required obligation with neither mapping nor waiver, is a verification **failure** — not a warning, not a nit. |

## Bootstrap

A repo with no contract yet, taking its first frontend work item:

1. **Detect runners.** Find the e2e harnesses the project actually has, per the Tool Discovery
   Process in `verification-lifecycle`. Record which platforms each covers.
2. **Scaffold the minimum** — `bdd/features/`, `bdd/coverage-map.json` (with `runnerPlatforms` and
   `testDiscovery` from step 1 — every root each runner's tests actually live in, subflow and helper
   directories included — and a coverage floor of the current, honest number), the regenerate +
   check scripts wired into the project's script surface, and the CI invocation of the check.
   Pre-existing tests that align to no product behavior are recorded as `exclusions` with reasons
   during this step, never left undisclosed.
3. **Write only this item's scenarios.** The first item is not a backfill project. Pre-existing
   uncovered behavior becomes burndown in `docs/e2e-bdd-coverage.md`, and the floor starts where the
   repo actually is. That is a one-time act, not a recurring one: from here on the floor stays put
   and what protects each new obligation is the per-obligation check, not the number.
4. **Seal this item's obligations** and commit the regenerated matrix and burndown with the change.

If a required platform has **no** e2e runner at all, that obligation is never left as a bare `N/A` —
record it exactly like any other unsealable obligation: a dated `platformWaivers` entry naming the
locations checked and "no runner configured" as the reason, so the absence is dated, audited for age,
and visible in the same place every other IOU lives — the same recorded-absence exit the
regression-spec rule in `verification` allows, made falsifiable. Where the runner could reasonably be
added, additionally file a linked build-ready follow-up ticket before merge and reference it from the
waiver's reason. Silence is never an exit.

## Degradation

Missing scaffolding degrades the run, it does not crash it: a project with no contract gets the
bootstrap path, an unreadable coverage map is reported as a blocker on the work item rather than
swallowed, and an absent optional runner is recorded as an absence with the locations checked. What
never degrades is the reporting — an agent that could not evaluate the contract says so explicitly
and does not report the item as done.
