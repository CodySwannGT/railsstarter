## Work-Item Definition of Ready (type-keyed)

**`ready` means: a stateless agent can claim this item and drive it to its terminal state with zero human clarification.** Every readiness gate exists because its absence forces a question; the bar is type-keyed because different work types break autonomy differently.

## Shared core (every leaf, enforced by `*-validate-*` S1–S16)

Three-audience description · Gherkin acceptance criteria (except Spike) · Out of Scope · single-repo scope · relationship search · typed evidence manifest on runtime changes · Source Requirement traceability when PRD-sourced · provable read access to every named external surface · declared reachability for any **existing** test the item pins as a red-before-green control (`control-reachability`, gate S20 — `N/A` when the item introduces a new test instead).

## Per-type additions

| Type | Must additionally carry | Terminal state is |
|---|---|---|
| **Bug** | agent-executable reproduction (or a failing test) · expected-vs-actual with the *source* of "expected" · environment + version observed, last-known-good when known · reproducibility rate (always / intermittent + frequency) · at least one occurrence evidence link | the same repro/test fails before the fix and passes after |
| **Story** | user-visible AC; SHOULD name non-happy-path states (error / empty / loading) for UI stories · design source precedence when artifacts exist | every AC exercised on the running product |
| **Task** | an observable done-state and the command/check that proves it | the verification check passes |
| **Improvement** | metric + measurement method the agent can run · measured baseline value · numeric target | measured value meets the target |
| **Spike** | the question · the decision it enables + options weighed · a timebox · deliverable format **and location** | a deliverable at the named location that answers the question — findings, decision, options weighed |
| **Sub-task** | a parent, always · otherwise the bar of its own type | per its type |
| **Epic / container** | never build-ready (`leaf-only-lifecycle`) · judged on decomposition completeness, not buildability | all required children terminal |

## The stateless-pickup test (S18)

The final gate checks the property itself instead of proxies for it: read the item as a fresh agent with no session context, using only the item and what it links to. List every question you would have to ask a human before starting, choosing between materially different implementations, or declaring done. **Ready = zero questions.** Each question found is the FAIL remediation, verbatim.

Sources this bar distills: INVEST (stories) · ISTQB / IEEE 1044 defect anatomy and minimal-reproducible-example practice (bugs) · SMART (improvements) · Scrum's Definition of Ready (the framing) · TASC AC8.6 (the normative criterion).

---

The eager head carries the table; this reference carries the reasoning, the
failure modes each requirement prevents, and worked examples. The enforcing
gates live in the three tracker validators (`lisa-jira-validate-ticket`,
`lisa-github-validate-issue`, `lisa-linear-validate-issue`), which cite this
rule so the bar cannot drift per vendor.

## The design principle

A readiness gate is justified by exactly one thing: **its absence forces a
human question.** The goal state is that a stateless agent — fresh session, no
memory of any prior conversation — claims any ready item and drives it to its
terminal state with zero human clarification. Every requirement below is an
answer to a question agents otherwise ask mid-flight, which is the most
expensive time to ask it: the item is claimed, the human is absent, and the
choice is stall (blocked, human round-trip) or guess (rework when wrong).

The bar is **type-keyed** because work types break autonomy differently. A
Story with perfect Gherkin but no design source makes the agent guess visuals.
A Bug with perfect prose but no executable repro makes the agent guess whether
it even fixed anything. One generic checklist over-asks some types (Gherkin on
a Spike is noise) and under-asks others (three bullets on a Bug).

## Bug — the defect anatomy

Modeled on the ISTQB defect-report content list, IEEE 1044, and
minimal-reproducible-example practice, tightened for a machine executor:

1. **Agent-executable reproduction.** Numbered steps a stateless agent can run
   mechanically: exact entry point, named account/role (consistent with the
   Sign-in Required section when authenticated), concrete data state, exact
   actions. "Open the dashboard and click around until it breaks" is
   human-followable, not agent-executable — it FAILs. A linked failing test
   satisfies this requirement outright and is the preferred form.
2. **Expected vs. actual, with the source of "expected."** Name or link where
   the expected behavior comes from — spec, PRD requirement, prior release. A
   fix target must be a fact, not an opinion, or the agent can confidently fix
   to the wrong behavior.
3. **Environment and version.** Where reproduced, and the build/commit
   observed. Include last-known-good when known — that regression window is
   what makes bisection possible. `unknown` is acceptable but must be stated.
4. **Reproducibility rate.** Always vs. intermittent (with observed
   frequency). An intermittent bug invalidates run-the-repro-once as a
   verification plan; the verifier needs to know to run it N times or
   instrument instead.
5. **Occurrence evidence.** At least one link or attachment proving the bug
   happened: error-tracker issue, log excerpt, stack trace, screenshot or
   recording. Input evidence, distinct from the output evidence manifest.

**Terminal state:** the reproduction (or failing test) fails before the fix
and passes after — both runs captured under the evidence manifest. This is
what makes a Bug autonomously closable: done-ness is a mechanical check, not a
judgment.

## Story

The generic gates (three audiences, Gherkin, Out of Scope, source precedence)
were designed around Stories, so Stories are the best-covered type already.
The additional expectations:

- UI-touching stories SHOULD name the non-happy-path states — error, empty,
  loading — in the AC. These are the states product-walkthroughs flag as
  missing after the fact; naming them up front converts a review finding into
  a requirement.
- Keep stories INVEST-small: a story too large to hold in one session is the
  leading cause of mid-flight questions. Prefer decomposition over heroics.

**Terminal state:** every AC scenario exercised against the running product.

## Task

A Task is "do this specific thing" — its risk is a fuzzy finish line, not a
fuzzy user. It must carry an observable done-state and the command or check
that proves it ("`bun run verify:x` exits 0", "the workflow file validates and
the job appears in CI"). **Terminal state:** that check passes.

## Improvement — the measured delta

An Improvement without numbers has no verifiable terminal state by
construction: "make it faster" can never be autonomously closed. Required:

1. **Metric + measurement method** the agent can run (command, query,
   dashboard export — something mechanical).
2. **Baseline** — the current measured value. A number, not an adjective.
3. **Target** — the numeric value or bound that defines done.

If no baseline exists yet, measuring it is the first task — file it as such.
**Terminal state:** the measurement method reports a value meeting the target.

## Spike — the investigation contract

A Spike's output is knowledge, so its readiness is about making knowledge
checkable:

1. **The question** being answered.
2. **The decision it enables**, and the options being weighed — so the answer
   is written to be decidable against, not merely interesting.
3. **A timebox** — spikes without one become open-ended research.
4. **Deliverable format and location** — decision doc, prototype, findings
   page, and *where it will live* (wiki page, decision record, attachment).

Gherkin AC is intentionally N/A for Spikes (S4 already exempts them).
**Terminal state:** a deliverable exists at the named location **and answers the
question** — it records the findings, the recommended decision, and the
options weighed. An empty or placeholder document at the right path is not
terminal.

## Sub-task

Always has a parent (no stranded-leaf exception), and otherwise carries the
bar of its own nature — a bug-shaped sub-task carries the bug anatomy.

## Epic and containers

Containers are never build-ready (`leaf-only-lifecycle`); their readiness
question is decomposition completeness — does every PRD requirement trace to a
leaf (`prd-ticket-coverage`) — not buildability.

## The stateless-pickup dry-run (gate S18)

Structure gates are proxies; this gate checks the property directly. The
validator simulates a stateless read of the item plus its resolvable links —
session knowledge deliberately excluded, because the next claimant will not
have it — and lists every question it would need answered before starting,
before choosing between materially different implementations, or before
declaring done. Zero questions = PASS. Each question found is emitted verbatim
as its own remediation line; those lines are exactly the clarifying comments
the caller posts to the source. This is the enforcement of the intake
contract's core promise, and of TASC AC8.6: *ready means zero-clarification
executable.*

## Relationship to the lifecycle

- **Write time** — `*-write-*` runs the applicable pre-write gates; a spec
  failing the type-keyed bar is repaired or rejected before it exists. S18 is
  not a write-time gate — most specs are not yet build-ready when written.
- **Ready time** — the bar is what the build-ready role asserts, and S18 runs
  here, on build-ready leaves only, making the assertion checked rather than
  hoped.
- **Claim time** — `ticket-triage` remains the analytical deep-check against
  the codebase (edge cases, duplicate work, rework classification). With this
  bar enforced upstream, triage's ambiguity phase should find nothing a
  validator could have caught — its findings become a monitoring signal for
  gaps in this rule.
